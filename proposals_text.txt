@Navi Marketplace — Full
Development Strategy
Webaroo Execution System · January 2026

1) Executive Summary
@Navi Marketplace is the global exchange for legacy assets — a platform reserved exclusively for
the top 1% of items valued in the millions. This document outlines the complete development
strategy across 3 phases and 6 core modules, from MVP to full enterprise deployment.
The system combines the exclusivity of a private social network (like Raya) with the rigor of institutional financial
infrastructure. It requires sophisticated trust infrastructure, AI-powered matching, and compliance-grade security.

2) The 6-Module Architecture
Based on the whitepaper and technical requirements, @Navi requires six foundational modules working in
concert. Each module is scoped across all three phases.

Module 1: Onboarding + Identity Verification (KYB/KYC)
The foundation of trust — a rigorous vetting gateway that exceeds standard financial compliance.
KYC Identity: Biometric + government ID verification (Onfido/Jumio integration)
AML Financials: Source of wealth audit, sanctions screening, PEP checks (ComplyAdvantage)
Social Vetting: Peer-review referral system + community reputation scoring
Dynamic Trust Score: Algorithm that evolves with deal history, disputes, and peer reviews
Tiered Verification: Basic → Enhanced → Institutional levels
Ongoing Monitoring: Continuous sanctions, PEP, and adverse media screening

Module 2: Relationship Custody + Ownership Proof
The core differentiator — cryptographic proof of relationship ownership with permanent attribution.
Relationship Import: Upload/import contacts with metadata preservation

Timestamp Ownership: Cryptographic claim of introduction priority (hash-based proof)
Blind Relationships: Keep relationships private until mutual consent
Forever Attribution: Originators get paid on follow-on deals (lifetime tracking)
Introduction Chains: Track multi-hop referrals with graph-based attribution flows

Module 3: Intent System + Blind Matching Engine (AI)
AI-powered semantic matching that reveals qualified counterparties exist before identity disclosure.
Structured Intents: Buy/sell/invest intents with detailed requirements
Vector Embeddings: Semantic matching via ML models (OpenAI embeddings + custom finetuning)
Confidence Thresholds: Configurable match quality requirements
Blind Reveal: "Qualified counterparty exists" notification before identity disclosure
Mutual Consent: Both parties agree → identities unlock → deal room opens
Zero-Knowledge Design: Matching runs on encrypted attributes where possible

Module 4: Deal Rooms + Audit Trail
Secure virtual deal rooms with enterprise-grade document management and immutable logging.
Virtual Deal Rooms: Per-match secure environment for negotiations
Document Sharing: Upload, versioning, and secure viewing with watermarking
Granular Permissions: Control who sees what at document and field level
E-Sign Integration: DocuSign/Adobe Sign for legally binding signatures
End-to-End Encryption: All communications and documents encrypted
Immutable Audit Logs: Every action timestamped and tamper-proof

Module 5: Compliance + Escrow + Closing Workflow
Multi-jurisdictional legal framework with insured escrow and structured closing process.
Per-Deal AML: Transaction-specific compliance checks
Jurisdictional Compliance: Multi-region regulatory adherence
Trusted Escrow: Integration with regulated escrow custodians
Milestone Releases: Fund release tied to authentication + transfer verification
Closing Checklist: Coordinated workflow across legal/finance/ops
Digital Provenance: Blockchain-backed certificate of authenticity

Module 6: Economics Engine + Automated Payout Rails
Sophisticated fee attribution with automated payouts and lifetime relationship economics.
Fee Split Definitions: Configurable originator + contributor splits

Milestone Triggers: Automated payouts on deal stage completion
Lifetime Attribution: Follow-on deals continue paying originator
Trajectory Tracking: Real-time deal progress + payout visibility
Flexible Pricing: Membership vs transaction fee model support
Payout Rails: Wire, ACH, and international transfer support

3) Phase 1: MVP (Months 1–4)
The MVP delivers a working platform for 10–50 beta users to complete real transactions. All 6
modules are present with core functionality — enough to validate the model and onboard initial highvalue members.

8) Why This Approach Is Better
WHY THIS IS MORE BENEFICIAL

All 6 modules from day one: Unlike approaches that build only 1–2 modules per phase, we
deliver a complete (if limited) system in Phase 1. This lets you validate the full user journey
with real transactions, not just isolated features.
14-month full platform vs 36+ months: Our phased approach delivers enterprise-grade
features in under 15 months. Traditional approaches often quote 3+ years for similar scope
— by which time market conditions and requirements have shifted.

Attribution + reporting before automation: For economics, we build accurate tracking and
settlement reporting first. This validates the data before building automated disbursement —
reducing financial risk and catching errors early.
Compliance built in, not bolted on: KYC/AML, audit logging, and security controls are core
to the architecture from Phase 1 — not added later when they're expensive to retrofit.
Graph database for relationships: Neo4j handles the complex relationship ownership,
intro chains, and attribution flows that would be painful in a traditional relational database.
This is a key architectural decision that pays dividends as the network grows.

9) Risk Mitigation
Specific strategies to address the concerns outlined in your intake form.
Concern

Mitigation Strategy

"Nothing works how we

Weekly demos with working software from week 3. You see progress

expect"

continuously, not just at the end. Rapid iteration based on your feedback.

"Users are not happy

User testing with beta participants throughout development. Design

with experience"

reviews every 2 weeks. UX metrics tracking from day one.

"Bad branding

Dedicated design system built on @Navi brand guidelines (navy/blue

palette, luxury aesthetic). Brand review gate before any public-facing
work.

"Tax and regulatory

KYC/AML baked into architecture, not bolted on. Legal compliance

review at each phase. SOC 2 readiness timeline from start.

"Complicated systems"

Simplicity as design principle. Progressive disclosure — advanced
features available but not in the way. Onboarding flows tested with real
users.

10) How We Work Together
Our Commitments
Communicative: Weekly video updates, Slack channel, real-time progress visibility
Transparent: Open time tracking, clear milestone definitions, no hidden costs

Oversight: You have full access to code repos, design files, and project management
Collaborative: We welcome your feedback and adjust course together
Passionate: We're genuinely excited about what @Navi represents for this market

Next Steps
This week: 60-minute alignment call to discuss this proposal and answer questions.
Week 1: Final SOW with detailed scope, timeline, and payment terms.
Week 2: Contract signing, initial payment, team introduction, project kickoff.

Conclusion
We can deliver the complete @Navi Marketplace platform across three phases: Phase 1 MVP
(4 months, $403K–$492K) → Phase 2 Scale (4 months, $333K–$418K) → Phase 3 Enterprise
(6 months, $321K–$405K). Full platform delivery in 14 months for $1.06M–$1.32M total
investment.
