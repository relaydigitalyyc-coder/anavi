=== TASK: Upgrade client/src/pages/Relationships.tsx for ANAVI whitepaper vision conformance ===
Module: RELATIONSHIP CUSTODY


=== ANAVI WHITEPAPER CONTEXT ===

ANAVI is "The Private Market Operating System" ("If Bloomberg runs public markets, ANAVI will run private ones").

Six core modules:
1. TRUST & IDENTITY — Trust Score (0-100), composite of KYB depth, transaction history,
   dispute outcomes, peer attestations. Three tiers: Basic / Enhanced / Institutional.
   Compliance Passport travels with every transaction.
2. RELATIONSHIP CUSTODY — Timestamped, cryptographically signed introductions.
   "Custodied" = protected with hash proof. "Open" = visible but unprotected.
3. BLIND MATCHING — Intents expressed anonymously. Counterparty identity sealed until
   mutual consent. Match cards: "Sealed -- [AssetClass]", compatibility score, deal size.
   "Blind Intent" = anonymous intent. "Blind Match" = sealed result brief.
4. DEAL ROOMS — NDA-gated workspaces. Immutable audit trail. Workflow:
   NDA Pending -> Active -> Diligence -> Closing -> Completed.
5. COMPLIANCE / ESCROW — KYB verified, OFAC clean, AML passed. Escrow milestones trigger automatically.
6. ECONOMICS ENGINE — Lifetime attribution. Originators earn 40-60% of fees. Follow-on deals
   compound. Attribution Chain. Payout types: originator_fee, introducer_fee, advisor_fee,
   milestone_bonus, success_fee.

Visual language:
- Navy: #0A1628 (darkest), #1E3A5F (body text/secondary)
- Gold: #C4972A (accent, CTAs)
- Trust green: #059669
- Cards: className="card-elevated p-6"
- Stat chips: "rounded-full bg-[COLOR]/15 px-3 py-1 text-xs font-semibold text-[COLOR]"
- Animations: FadeInView, StaggerContainer, StaggerItem (from @/components/PageTransition)
- Numbers: font-data-hud class; hashes/IDs: font-data-mono class

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

Your task: upgrade Relationships.tsx for whitepaper vision conformance.

SPECIFIC ISSUES TO FIX:
1. Page heading "Relationships" -> "Relationship Custody".
   Add a subtitle: "Timestamped introductions with cryptographic proof of custody."
2. The filter options for verification/visibility status:
   - "Protected" -> "Custodied"
   - "Visible" -> "Open"
   Update both the filter option labels and any status badges on relationship cards.
3. Where the custody hash is shown, label it "Custody Proof" (not just "Hash" or unlabeled).
   Use font-data-mono class for the hash value.
4. In the "Protect a Relationship" modal step 5 (the confirmation screen), import
   CUSTODY_RECEIPT from @/lib/copy and use CUSTODY_RECEIPT.title and CUSTODY_RECEIPT.body
   as the confirmation text.
5. In the 4-stat cards, "Total Relationships" can become "Custodied Relationships".

DO NOT CHANGE: All trpc.relationship.* queries/mutations, all 5 modal steps, the proof
export modal, the grid/list toggle, all 4 filter dropdowns, the detail sheet.



=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks):
{
  "upgraded_tsx": "<complete upgraded TypeScript/TSX file content>",
  "changes_summary": ["change 1", "change 2"],
  "whitepaper_terms_added": ["term 1", "term 2"],
  "copy_tokens_used": ["DASHBOARD.xxx", "TOUR.xxx"]
}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. upgraded_tsx must be the COMPLETE file — do not truncate.
2. Preserve ALL existing tRPC queries and mutations — do not remove any.
3. Preserve ALL existing form logic, modals, validation.
4. Only change: copy/labels, visual aesthetics, terminology alignment.
5. Do not add new tRPC queries unless explicitly instructed.
6. TypeScript must compile — no implicit any, no missing imports.
7. Only import from libraries already in the project: react, wouter, framer-motion,
   lucide-react, sonner, date-fns, @/lib/trpc, @/lib/copy, @/components/ui/*,
   @/components/EmptyState, @/components/PageTransition, @/components/PremiumAnimations,
   @/_core/hooks/useAuth.
