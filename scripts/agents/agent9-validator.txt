The left column effectively groups primary actions and the Trust Score, while the center column is dedicated to primary content like matches and activity. The right column serves well for secondary information. Animations (stagger, fade-in, smooth counter) enhance the premium feel. However, the 'Quick Actions' buttons feel somewhat generic, and 'Pending Actions' could be more integrated with a broader 'Compliance' view.

However, the dashboard currently leans more towards a modern, clean SaaS aesthetic rather than the dense, information-rich, and often 'power-user' interface of a Bloomberg Terminal. There's a significant amount of whitespace, and some interactive elements (like the generic 'Quick Actions' buttons) lack the sophistication expected of an 'Operating System for Private Markets'. The overall experience feels a bit too 'friendly' and not 'commanding' enough.",
      "what_would_make_it_10": "To achieve a 10, the dashboard needs to embrace higher information density, potentially with configurable widgets and a more 'data-hud' aesthetic. This would involve more sophisticated data visualizations (e.g., small sparklines, network graphs for relationships, trend charts for economics), a prominent and always-available command palette for rapid navigation and actions (akin to Bloomberg's command line), and a greater emphasis on real-time data streams. The UI should feel less like a collection of cards and more like an integrated, powerful control center. Richer, more detailed tooltips and hover states, along with a more 'compact' default view, would also contribute to a 'Bloomberg Terminal meets private club' feel, where advanced features are readily accessible but not overwhelming."

The primary concern is the existence of two distinct tour attribute systems (`data-tour` for demo, `data-tour-id` for live app) which are causing confusion and selector drift. Specifically, the `tourDefinitions` (main app tour) attempts to target a `Trust Score` element using `data-tour-id='trust-score'`, but this attribute is missing in `DashboardLayout.tsx`, while `Dashboard.tsx` incorrectly uses `data-tour=\"trust-score\"` for a similar element. This highlights a need for strict adherence to the `data-tour-id` convention for the main app tour.\n\nFurthermore, `onboardingTour` and `demoTour` in `client/src/lib/tourDefinitions.ts` are identified as dead code, as they are not imported or used by any active components, despite misleading comments suggesting `onboardingTour` is for live app onboarding. This indicates a need for codebase cleanup.\n\nFinally, there's an inconsistency in `tourId` alignment: the `Payouts` navigation item in `DashboardLayout.tsx` has a `tourId=\"nav-payouts\"`, but no corresponding step exists in the `tourDefinitions` for the main app tour. This suggests an incomplete tour experience.\n\nThe proposed patches address these issues by adding the missing `data-tour-id` attribute to the Trust Score in `DashboardLayout.tsx` and introducing a `Payouts` step to the main app tour definitions, alongside recommending removal of dead code and clarification of documentation."

To further enhance the narrative quality and whitepaper alignment, consider the following: \n1.  **Utilize Unused User Fields**: Introduce a 'Profile Snapshot' or 'My Stats' card on the dashboard that leverages currently unused `user` fields such as `email`, `kybStatus`, `onboardingCompleted`, `relationshipCount`, `aum`, and `upgradePromptActive`. This would make the persona profiles feel more complete and demonstrate more aspects of the Identity/KYC module. \n2.  **Integrate Relationships Data**: Create a 'Recent Relationships' card on the dashboard to display items from the `relationships` array. This would directly highlight the 'Relationship Custody' module, a core ANAVI offering, which is currently not represented on the dashboard. \n3.  **Enhance Payouts Card**: As noted in 'whitepaper_alignment_issues', modifying the 'Recent Payouts' card in `Dashboard.tsx` to display persona-specific metrics (e.g., originator share percentage, IRR/Vintage, escrow milestones/next triggers) would significantly deepen the narrative impact and showcase the 'Economics Engine' and 'Compliance/Escrow' modules more effectively for each persona. \n4.  **Expand Notifications**: While current notifications are excellent, adding more variety or a 'progress' notification (e.g., 'Your Trust Score increased by 3 points') could further enrich the dynamic feel of the platform."

# AUDIT TASK
1. Identify conflicts (two agents proposing different changes to the same file/line)
2. Identify ordering dependencies (patch B must apply after patch A)
3. Find gaps (findings implied by one agent's output that others missed)
4. Produce the definitive consolidated priority-ordered list of all patches to apply

Focus on the HIGHEST IMPACT changes first:
- Critical bugs (broken selectors, wrong data)
- Missing whitepaper alignment
- Navigation/routing issues
- TypeScript/type safety

Return EXACTLY this JSON (no markdown, pure JSON):
