=== TASK: Upgrade client/src/pages/Verification.tsx for ANAVI whitepaper vision conformance ===
Module: TRUST SCORE / IDENTITY & KYC


=== ANAVI WHITEPAPER CONTEXT ===

ANAVI is "The Private Market Operating System" ("If Bloomberg runs public markets, ANAVI will run private ones").

Six core modules:
1. TRUST & IDENTITY — Trust Score (0-100), composite of KYB depth, transaction history,
   dispute outcomes, peer attestations. Three tiers: Basic / Enhanced / Institutional.
   Compliance Passport travels with every transaction.
2. RELATIONSHIP CUSTODY — Timestamped, cryptographically signed introductions.
   "Custodied" = protected with hash proof. "Open" = visible but unprotected.
3. BLIND MATCHING — Intents expressed anonymously. Counterparty identity sealed until
   mutual consent. Match cards: "Sealed -- [AssetClass]", compatibility score, deal size.
   "Blind Intent" = anonymous intent. "Blind Match" = sealed result brief.
4. DEAL ROOMS — NDA-gated workspaces. Immutable audit trail. Workflow:
   NDA Pending -> Active -> Diligence -> Closing -> Completed.
5. COMPLIANCE / ESCROW — KYB verified, OFAC clean, AML passed. Escrow milestones trigger automatically.
6. ECONOMICS ENGINE — Lifetime attribution. Originators earn 40-60% of fees. Follow-on deals
   compound. Attribution Chain. Payout types: originator_fee, introducer_fee, advisor_fee,
   milestone_bonus, success_fee.

Visual language:
- Navy: #0A1628 (darkest), #1E3A5F (body text/secondary)
- Gold: #C4972A (accent, CTAs)
- Trust green: #059669
- Cards: className="card-elevated p-6"
- Stat chips: "rounded-full bg-[COLOR]/15 px-3 py-1 text-xs font-semibold text-[COLOR]"
- Animations: FadeInView, StaggerContainer, StaggerItem (from @/components/PageTransition)

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

Your task: upgrade Verification.tsx for whitepaper vision conformance.

SPECIFIC ISSUES TO FIX:
1. The radar chart has a duplicate dimension label -- "verification" appears twice.
   Fix the DIMENSIONS array so all 6 names are unique. Rename them to match whitepaper:
   "KYB Depth", "Transaction History", "Dispute Outcomes", "Peer Attestations",
   "Platform Tenure", "Identity Verification" (these are the 6 components of Trust Score).
2. The hardcoded string "12 institutional partners" -- replace with a variable:
   const PARTNER_COUNT = 12; // TODO: source from live data
   and reference {PARTNER_COUNT} institutional partners in the JSX.
3. Mark the SCORE_HISTORY array as a placeholder:
   Add comment // TODO: replace with live trpc.user.getTrustScoreHistory data
   above the SCORE_HISTORY constant.
4. The page title can stay "Verification & Trust". The tier badge labels can add the
   whitepaper tier names: "Basic", "Enhanced", "Institutional" (check if already present).

DO NOT CHANGE: All tRPC queries, the 6-component score cards, the tier upgrade modal,
the document upload section, the Compliance Passport card, the Share & Access controls.



=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks):
{
  "upgraded_tsx": "<complete upgraded TypeScript/TSX file content>",
  "changes_summary": ["change 1", "change 2"],
  "whitepaper_terms_added": ["term 1", "term 2"],
  "copy_tokens_used": ["DASHBOARD.xxx", "TOUR.xxx"]
}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. upgraded_tsx must be the COMPLETE file — do not truncate.
2. Preserve ALL existing tRPC queries and mutations — do not remove any.
3. Preserve ALL existing form logic, modals, validation.
4. Only change: copy/labels, visual aesthetics, terminology alignment.
5. Do not add new tRPC queries unless explicitly instructed.
6. TypeScript must compile — no implicit any, no missing imports.
7. Only import from libraries already in the project: react, wouter, framer-motion,
   lucide-react, sonner, date-fns, @/lib/trpc, @/lib/copy, @/components/ui/*,
   @/components/EmptyState, @/components/PageTransition, @/components/PremiumAnimations,
   @/_core/hooks/useAuth.
