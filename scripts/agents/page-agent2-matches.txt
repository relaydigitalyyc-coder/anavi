=== TASK: Upgrade client/src/pages/Matches.tsx for ANAVI whitepaper vision conformance ===
Module: BLIND MATCHING -- Sealed Match Results


=== ANAVI WHITEPAPER CONTEXT ===

ANAVI is "The Private Market Operating System" ("If Bloomberg runs public markets, ANAVI will run private ones").

Six core modules:
1. TRUST & IDENTITY — Trust Score (0-100), composite of KYB depth, transaction history,
   dispute outcomes, peer attestations. Three tiers: Basic / Enhanced / Institutional.
   Compliance Passport travels with every transaction.
2. RELATIONSHIP CUSTODY — Timestamped, cryptographically signed introductions.
   "Custodied" = protected with hash proof. "Open" = visible but unprotected.
3. BLIND MATCHING — Intents expressed anonymously. Counterparty identity sealed until
   mutual consent. Match cards: "Sealed -- [AssetClass]", compatibility score, deal size.
   "Blind Intent" = anonymous intent. "Blind Match" = sealed result brief.
4. DEAL ROOMS — NDA-gated workspaces. Immutable audit trail. Workflow:
   NDA Pending -> Active -> Diligence -> Closing -> Completed.
5. COMPLIANCE / ESCROW — KYB verified, OFAC clean, AML passed. Escrow milestones trigger automatically.
6. ECONOMICS ENGINE — Lifetime attribution. Originators earn 40-60% of fees. Follow-on deals
   compound. Attribution Chain. Payout types: originator_fee, introducer_fee, advisor_fee,
   milestone_bonus, success_fee.

Visual language:

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

Your task: upgrade Matches.tsx for whitepaper vision conformance.

SPECIFIC ISSUES TO FIX:
1. Page heading "AI Matches" -> "Blind Matches". Stat card label "Total Matches" -> "Blind Matches".
2. Each match card should have the sealed-brief aesthetic from the upgraded Dashboard:
   - Add a subtle dark gradient overlay (bg-gradient-to-br from-[#0A1628]/5 to-transparent)
   - Add a "SEALED -- [assetClass]" badge (gold) at top-left of each card
   - Add a Lock icon (from lucide-react) at top-right
   - Import Lock from lucide-react if not already imported
3. Fix: const isUser1 = true; (hardcoded). Instead derive it:
   - Import useAuth from @/_core/hooks/useAuth
   - const { user } = useAuth();
   - const isUser1 = match.user1Id === user?.id;
   Note: check the exact field name on the match object (may be user1Id, userId1, etc.)
   -- if the field does not exist, add a comment // TODO: derive from match.user1Id and
   keep the hardcoded fallback rather than introducing a TS error.
4. The compatibility score progress bar label could say "Match Compatibility" instead of
   just showing a number.

DO NOT CHANGE: All trpc.match.* queries/mutations, status pills, action buttons
(Express Interest, Decline, Create Deal Room, Go to Deal Room), the AI Analysis section.



=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks):
{
  "upgraded_tsx": "<complete upgraded TypeScript/TSX file content>",
  "changes_summary": ["change 1", "change 2"],
  "whitepaper_terms_added": ["term 1", "term 2"],
  "copy_tokens_used": ["DASHBOARD.xxx", "TOUR.xxx"]
}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. upgraded_tsx must be the COMPLETE file — do not truncate.
2. Preserve ALL existing tRPC queries and mutations — do not remove any.
3. Preserve ALL existing form logic, modals, validation.
4. Only change: copy/labels, visual aesthetics, terminology alignment.
5. Do not add new tRPC queries unless explicitly instructed.
6. TypeScript must compile — no implicit any, no missing imports.
7. Only import from libraries already in the project: react, wouter, framer-motion,
   lucide-react, sonner, date-fns, @/lib/trpc, @/lib/copy, @/components/ui/*,
   @/components/EmptyState, @/components/PageTransition, @/components/PremiumAnimations,
   @/_core/hooks/useAuth.
