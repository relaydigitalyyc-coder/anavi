You are a senior frontend engineer auditing the ANAVI tour system for selector drift, dead code, and semantic inconsistencies. Be hyper-meticulous.


ANAVI WHITEPAPER VISION (condensed):
- "The Private Market Operating System" — "If Bloomberg runs public markets, ANAVI will run private ones."
- Positioning: neutral trust infrastructure for the $13+ trillion private markets ecosystem
- Eliminates: broker chains (5-15 per deal), relationship leakage, due diligence duplication, fraud

6 CORE MODULES:
1. Identity/KYC — Trust Score (dynamic, compound), verification tiers: Basic/Enhanced/Institutional, KYB
2. Relationship Custody — Cryptographic timestamps, blind until consent, forever attribution (originators get 40-60%)
3. Blind Matching — Intent-based (Buy/Sell/Invest intents), anonymized until mutual consent, compatibility scoring
4. Deal Rooms — NDA-gated, document versioning, e-signature, immutable audit trail, escrow milestones
5. Compliance/Escrow — AML/KYC rails, OFAC screening, per-deal compliance, milestone-triggered fund release
6. Economics Engine — Automated payouts on deal close, lifetime attribution for follow-on deals, trajectory tracking

TARGET PERSONAS:
- Deal Originator/Broker: "My introductions close deals I never get credit for." → custody + lifetime attribution
- Investor/Family Office: "I can't tell which deals are real." → verified counterparties + blind matching
- Project Developer/Asset Owner: "Raising capital means exposing my thesis." → anonymous until consent

UX PRINCIPLES (from Webaroo spec):
- Navy/blue palette, luxury aesthetic, institutional-grade
- "Simplicity as design principle. Progressive disclosure — advanced features available but not in the way."
- The platform should feel like Bloomberg Terminal meets private club

THE TRANSFORMATION:
Before: 5-15 broker chains → After: Direct verified counterparty access
Before: Manual costly due diligence → After: Pre-verified participant network
Before: Relationship leakage + circumvention → After: Custodied relationships with lifetime attribution
Before: Opaque, negotiated fees → After: Transparent, automated economics
Before: High fraud risk → After: Trust-scored network with blacklist controls
Before: One-time transaction relationships → After: Compounding relationship value over time

CODEBASE ARCHITECTURE:
- Client: React 19, Vite, wouter, tRPC React Query, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui, framer-motion
- Server: Node, Express, tRPC v11, Drizzle ORM (MySQL/TiDB)
- Working dir: anavi/
- Key paths: client/src/pages/ (40+ pages), client/src/components/, client/src/lib/, client/src/contexts/
- Route wrappers: ShellRoute (auth + DashboardLayout + PageTransition), ProtectedPage (auth only), Bare (public)

# AUDIT TASK
There are TWO tour systems in ANAVI that use different attribute conventions:
1. GuidedTour (demo experience) — uses `data-tour="value"` selectors → `[data-tour="value"]`
2. TourOverlay (live app onboarding) — uses `data-tour-id="value"` selectors → `[data-tour-id='value']`

These two systems should NOT be confused. Audit every step in every tour definition.

For each `targetSelector` in every tour (onboardingTour, demoTour, buildDemoTourSteps, tourDefinitions):
1. Does the selector exist in the DOM? (check Dashboard.tsx and DashboardLayout.tsx)
2. Is it using the correct attribute (`data-tour` vs `data-tour-id`)?
3. Is the step title/content still accurate?

Also check:
- Are there any exported symbols that are never imported anywhere?
- Is there semantic overlap between demoTour (legacy) and buildDemoTourSteps (current)?
- Does `tourId` naming in DashboardLayout.tsx navItems match `target` in tour/definitions.ts?

Return EXACTLY this JSON (no markdown, pure JSON):
