Additionally, the 'Intents' and 'Relationships' pages currently lack explicit empty state components for when no data is present, unlike other audited pages ('Matches', 'Deal Rooms', 'Payouts') which utilize the `EmptyState` component. Due to the truncation of the provided file content, precise insertions for these missing empty states cannot be provided as targeted corrections.",
