To further enhance the narrative quality and whitepaper alignment, consider the following: \\n1.  **Utilize Unused User Fields**: Introduce a 'Profile Snapshot' or 'My Stats' card on the dashboard that leverages currently unused `user` fields such as `email`, `kybStatus`, `onboardingCompleted`, `relationshipCount`, `aum`, and `upgradePromptActive`. This would make the persona profiles feel more complete and demonstrate more aspects of the Identity/KYC module. \\n2.  **Integrate Relationships Data**: Create a 'Recent Relationships' card on the dashboard to display items from the `relationships` array. This would directly highlight the 'Relationship Custody' module, a core ANAVI offering, which is currently not represented on the dashboard. \\n3.  **Enhance Payouts Card**: As noted in 'whitepaper_alignment_issues', modifying the 'Recent Payouts' card in `Dashboard.tsx` to display persona-specific metrics (e.g., originator share percentage, IRR/Vintage, escrow milestones/next triggers) would significantly deepen the narrative impact and showcase the 'Economics Engine' and 'Compliance/Escrow' modules more effectively for each persona. \\n4.  **Expand Notifications**: While current notifications are excellent, adding more variety or a 'progress' notification (e.g., 'Your Trust Score increased by 3 points') could further enrich the dynamic feel of the platform.\"\n}\n```"
