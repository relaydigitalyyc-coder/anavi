This would involve more sophisticated data visualizations (e.g., small sparklines, network graphs for relationships, trend charts for economics), a prominent and always-available command palette for rapid navigation and actions (akin to Bloomberg's command line), and a greater emphasis on real-time data streams. The UI should feel less like a collection of cards and more like an integrated, powerful control center. Richer, more detailed tooltips and hover states, along with a more 'compact' default view, would also contribute to a 'Bloomberg Terminal meets private club' feel, where advanced features are readily accessible but not overwhelming."
