  "summary": "The ANAVI onboarding flow presents a strong visual and interactive experience, aligning well with the 'luxury aesthetic' and 'institutional-grade' UX principles. The persona-specific paths are a thoughtful implementation. However, the flow currently underutilizes the powerful problem-solution framing articulated in the whitepaper and `lib/copy.ts`. Key 'aha' moments for non-Originator personas are less impactful than the Originator's custody receipt, and there are inconsistencies in copy sourcing. Addressing these issues, particularly by explicitly stating the problems ANAVI solves upfront and tailoring the value proposition more precisely at each step, will significantly enhance alignment with the whitepaper's vision and create a more compelling first impression."
