Add visual indicator for 'Whitelist Status'. Rename 'Pending Actions' to 'Compliance Status' and introduce 'Compliance Passport' summary. (Agent 1)\\n   - **Relationship Custody**: Create a 'Custodied Relationships' widget (left column) showing summary, 'custody age', 'attribution status'. Elevate 'Protect Relationship' CTA. Add visual cues for 'cryptographic timestamps' and 'forever attribution'. (Agent 1)\\n   - **Blind Matching**: Add 'Your Active Intents' summary section above 'Blind Matches' list. (Agent 1)\\n   - **Deal Rooms**: Prioritize wiring to live data (not just demo fixtures). Enhance cards to display 'Audit Events' and 'Document Count' to highlight immutable audit trail and versioning. (Agent 1)\\n   - **Economics Engine**: Make 'Next Payout' dynamic. Add 'Lifetime Attribution Value' or 'Compounding Value' metric. Enhance 'Recent Payouts' to display persona-specific metrics (originator share, IRR/Vintage, escrow milestones/next triggers). (Agent 1, Agent 4)\\n   - **Utilize Unused Demo Data**: Introduce a 'Profile Snapshot' or 'My Stats' card leveraging unused `user` fields (email, kybStatus, onboardingCompleted, relationshipCount, aum, upgradePromptActive) to enrich persona profiles. (Agent 4)\",\n    \"2. **Visual Hierarchy & Institutional Feel (High Impact UX)**\\n   - Elevate Trust Score to a more prominent, potentially wider, hero section. (Agent 1)\\n   - Consolidate 'Quick Actions' and 'Pending Actions' into more sophisticated, data-driven widgets (e.g., 'Your Active Intents', 'Compliance Status'). (Agent 1)\\n   - Increase information density in key content areas (match cards, deal rooms) to surface more whitepaper concepts (audit trails, attribution details) without sacrificing readability. (Agent 1)\\n   - Implement more sophisticated data visualizations (sparklines, network graphs, trend charts) and a prominent command palette for a 'Bloomberg Terminal' feel. (Agent 1)\\n   - Replace the large 'Welcome Banner' with a more subtle, dismissible notification or integrate it into a guided onboarding tour prompt. (Agent 1)\",\n    \"3. **Copy & Terminology Consistency (Foundational)**\\n   - Replace all identified hardcoded strings with dynamic data or new/existing copy tokens from `lib/copy.ts`. (Agent 1, Agent 5)\\n   - Centralize all module and navigation labels in `client/src/lib/copy.ts` to ensure consistent whitepaper terminology (e.g., 'Verification Tier', 'Lifetime Attribution', 'Blind Matching', 'Escrow Milestone'). (Agent 5)\",\n    \"4. **Navigation & Routing Accuracy (Critical Functionality)**\\n   - Implement the `proposed_nav_sections_final` structure, ensuring all core modules are accessible with correct whitepaper-aligned labels. (Agent 2, Agent 5)\\n   - Correct route wrappers for `/manifesto` and `/operator-intake` from `ShellRoute` to `ProtectedPage`. (Agent 2)\\n   - Hide all identified Phase 2 verticals and internal tools from main navigation. (Agent 2)\",\n    \"5. **Tour System Reliability (User Onboarding)**\\n   - Standardize tour attribute system to `data-tour-id` for the main app tour. (Agent 3)\\n   - Apply patches to `DashboardLayout.tsx` to add missing `data-tour-id` for Trust Score. (Agent 3)\\n   - Add missing tour steps for navigation items (e.g., Payouts) to `client/src/tour/definitions.ts`. (Agent 3)\\n   - Update tour step selectors for renamed/re-attributed dashboard elements (e.g., 'verification' to 'compliance-status'). (Agent 1, Agent 3)\\n   - Remove dead tour exports (`onboardingTour`, `demoTour`). (Agent 3)\"\n  ],\n  \"validation_summary\": \"The ANAVI platform's current state shows a solid foundation but requires significant refinement to fully embody its 'Private Market Operating System' vision and align with the whitepaper. Key areas for improvement include:\\n\\n1.  **Whitepaper Alignment & Data Utilization**: Many core whitepaper concepts (e.g., dynamic Trust Score components, cryptographic timestamps, lifetime attribution, detailed deal room audit trails, persona-specific economic metrics) are either missing from the dashboard or not explicitly surfaced, despite underlying data existing in demo fixtures. The dashboard needs to become a richer, more data-dense 'control center' that actively showcases ANAVI's unique value propositions.\\n2.  **User Experience & Institutional Feel**: While the aesthetic is good, the dashboard lacks the information density and 'power-user' features expected of an institutional-grade platform. A more commanding UX, with sophisticated data visualizations and a clearer hierarchy, is needed to align with the 'Bloomberg Terminal meets private club' vision.\\n3.  **Copy & Terminology Consistency**: Inconsistent terminology and numerous hardcoded strings across the UI dilute the brand message and make future localization difficult. A centralized, whitepaper-aligned copy system is paramount.\\n4.  **Navigation & Routing Accuracy**: The navigation structure needs to be updated to reflect the 6 core modules accurately, ensuring critical pages are accessible and internal/future features are appropriately hidden or wrapped.\\n5.  **Tour System Reliability**: The current tour system suffers from attribute confusion and incomplete coverage, hindering effective user onboarding and feature discovery.\\n\\nThe proposed changes prioritize fixing critical bugs, aligning the UI with whitepaper concepts, enhancing the institutional UX, and establishing robust copy and navigation systems. This will ensure ANAVI delivers on its promise of being the Bloomberg for private markets.\"\n}\n```"
