Beyond this, the audit revealed several unsafe type patterns, primarily in 'Dashboard.tsx', where explicit 'any' casts are used unnecessarily for demo data, bypassing TypeScript's type inference. There's also a minor implicit 'any' risk with 'JSON.parse'. A notable type divergence exists in the 'payouts' data structure between demo fixtures and the expected live tRPC response, leading to separate rendering logic. Addressing the missing package and removing the explicit 'any' casts will significantly improve the codebase's type safety and maintainability.\"\n}\n```"
