avraham adler: Like, let's say you look at our gallery like I'm trusting you right now.
avraham adler: I'm just sharing all because, you know, I think we have the energy and the vibes and see visions.
avraham adler: Then they were all.
avraham adler: You kind of just have that sense, you know, you're, you're, you could just tell something that people can change and make different.
avraham adler: You know, everyone's unit have the freedom to choose, but for the most part, you know, your instinct usually tells you, hey, this art thing, just a guy who's experienced in art, goes to a gallery and he's like, I don't know, something's off about that trust.
Nikita Tyukalo: Exactly.
avraham adler: Tipping point, which is essentially what put people to catapult, you know, IBM or, you know, Bill Gates being in the right time, right place.
avraham adler: It's a mix because they had like a long Harvard review of, you know, following the highest IQ people and some of them would be homeless, some of them would be successful, some of them.
avraham adler: So like, where was the pattern in madness?
avraham adler: And it's a mix of all.
avraham adler: And it's essentially, I mean, I'll talk as a religious guy, as God, but you have, you know, being at the right time, right place and having access to infrastructure and things that, you know, can implement.
avraham adler: Yeah, all these type of stuff.

avraham adler: And it's going to be able to be plug and play in like all internal Servers, right.
avraham adler: We want to be.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes, completely.
avraham adler: That's our goal.
avraham adler: To disrupt like all these high net worth individual networks.
avraham adler: That just makes it richer, rich, bridge the gap between the ultra net worthy and the ones that don't have access and then better mental humankind honestly across the spectrum want to have 10 to 20% allocated to nonprofit trust.
avraham adler: That's going to be part of the revenue that's going to be overseen by a board of, you know, all type of religious leaders and business people.
avraham adler: So you have, you know, the spirituality of it as well as the practicality of it as board members without having like CEOs being paid a million dollars to run Red Cross and just spending so much money on events to get donations to, you know, basically make, you know.
Nikita Tyukalo: Exactly higher ethically men scale it.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then looking through like one thing that I always wanted to do was like you're going to find the high leverage talent in some of these poorer areas.
Nikita Tyukalo: So by just by searching for it, purely for that, the returns will be big like building, building knowledge hubs.
avraham adler: And I've been meeting with a carbon credit guy I have a meeting with, you know, all these types.
avraham adler: I'm looking for experienced people who share the same vision.
avraham adler: And one stroke.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
avraham adler: And then we're not even talking about health care, you know, nursing homes, mental health facilities, drug and abuse rehab.
Nikita Tyukalo: There was a, there was a billionaire mentor that I met briefly at a monastery in Curacao.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's, he's a developer.
Nikita Tyukalo: He owns like in Curacao you can actually buy the coastline which is crazy.
Nikita Tyukalo: You can, me as an, as a foreigner can walk up by the beach and then open a resort by building a building.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like what, 500ft or no, sorry, 500 meters, 600 meters from the coast and it's just that simple.
Nikita Tyukalo: There's no, no blocking whatsoever.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like the biggest landowner is like a law firm out there.
Nikita Tyukalo: IUV law firm.
Nikita Tyukalo: This is Curacao, the island and the population is only 100k.
Nikita Tyukalo: The models are out there.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's like a. Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: One thing I noticed also is like he, he was, he was trying to convert an old, an old boarding school into a similar thing like a care home.
Nikita Tyukalo: Because a lot of people will go there and retire in their old days.
Nikita Tyukalo: So he was, he was converting that old, old building out there into mental health facility care home run by the nuns.
Nikita Tyukalo: Integrated with all that.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
avraham adler: People could choose their own lifestyle, you know, what they want, what speaks to them.
avraham adler: We're just going to provide them the ability to do so and tell them what we think the best suited for them and let them decide for themselves.
Nikita Tyukalo: Exactly.
avraham adler: The healthcare system revamped.
avraham adler: You know I have pharma.
avraham adler: We have distributions of pharma and we'll have access to the bottom net pricing and how much research cost and all that.
avraham adler: Insurances.
avraham adler: I asked my friend to send me an insurance that we have our own insurance so it could support all the assets that we'll own integration of that underwriting cost like a Brooklyn Halfshire.
Nikita Tyukalo: A lot.
Nikita Tyukalo: Really?
avraham adler: And that'll be the idea.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh yeah.
avraham adler: I mean here's what he called it.
avraham adler: I mean I looked when I researched them like what am I missing?
avraham adler: And ChatGPT told me that that he said I wanted to get a TPA mga captive difference.
avraham adler: We also need to tackle education it said and distribution.
avraham adler: So we want captive insurance with brokerage and specialty risk.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes.
avraham adler: See, everybody kept telling me I'm doing too much.
avraham adler: I'm all over the place.
avraham adler: I'm scared.
avraham adler: And I'm like no, I have a vision.

Nikita Tyukalo: We have a structure and a flow for system for launching apps, consumer apps.
Nikita Tyukalo: Dating apps is going to be a big niche, probably 50%.
Nikita Tyukalo: Then the other 50% would be like.
avraham adler: Because now they're all just pushing their own product.
avraham adler: They're just, you know that they're just pushing people to pay for the subscriptions to get.
Nikita Tyukalo: Exactly.
avraham adler: And you have like, it's one out of a hundred for every.
avraham adler: Every.
avraham adler: I think it's one.
avraham adler: I forgot the numbers.
avraham adler: Crazy numbers.
avraham adler: One out of a thousand swipes for a guy gets a.
avraham adler: Maybe a date and which translates to like, maybe, you know, a relationship.
Nikita Tyukalo: We can also push them towards our models as well.

Nikita Tyukalo: That's true.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's true.

avraham adler: If you want to have five girlfriends, some.
avraham adler: Whatever is everyone's into, you know, living in a world where everyone has different relationship ideas of what works for them.

avraham adler: I have a sex club also that wants to open many more locations.
Nikita Tyukalo: I had an idea for the dating app.
Nikita Tyukalo: You.
Nikita Tyukalo: You basically, you scan in your face and your voice and then it gives you, like Tinder swipes of you and who the person would be as a partner or whatever.
Nikita Tyukalo: And like a small scene and then you can swipe yes or no.
avraham adler: Yep, yep.
avraham adler: And we have the AI integration for the models also that we can use it for that.

avraham adler: And again, fashion brands, you know, like the virtual ones.
avraham adler: You know how you're going to look at it, making an avatar, the metaverse, all that stuff.
avraham adler: No, no, this.
Nikita Tyukalo: This can definitely be.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then of course, obvious, obviously, the E commerce side of things.
avraham adler: Yeah, the distribution alliances, the tick tock, the pushing the product, the channels.
Nikita Tyukalo: If we do like an influencer marketplace and then have them all do one brand as their introductory offer.
Nikita Tyukalo: Because it's kind of what I told you.
avraham adler: It's gonna be geolocation.
avraham adler: So we have data alliances with like army technology to.
avraham adler: To take the data from there to see where it should go and business sectors.
avraham adler: You like that?
avraham adler: This is another thing that somebody presented to me.
avraham adler: And then I have the AI to take things again.
avraham adler: I want to overwhelm you and show everything.
avraham adler: I want to see how it formed.
+44 775* ****85: Yes.
avraham adler: Passing View.
avraham adler: And then also the websites.

Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, guys, one thing I wanted to show you was like VX something we have running in.
avraham adler: Can I get the sound to work?
avraham adler: Let me try and join.

avraham adler: As far as vx, we have a real estate here.
avraham adler: I'll send it to you.
avraham adler: It's going to be a bidding thing.

Nikita Tyukalo: So, yeah, basically we're just trying to become the go to, I guess, seller for these agents.
avraham adler: Okay.
avraham adler: So kind of like I was saying, a centralized system.
Nikita Tyukalo: Exactly.
Nikita Tyukalo: Being the middleman, helping Them do stuff that they don't have to be themselves.
avraham adler: Did you look at the AI page I sent you?
avraham adler: Oh yeah, we'll check it out for the service.
avraham adler: All the service sector like invoicing and you know, plumbing and construction workers to do their estimating and all that.
avraham adler: Because we could onboard the construction providers as well.
avraham adler: You know, we could have top of the top and who is capable of handling where in what location and provide those services to allow people to choose.
avraham adler: I mean they have like they have, they have data central, I don't know what they call them.
avraham adler: Not CRMs but like just you know, people join like a database and people can join which you want to you know, address and send to.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, I'm basically like it's funny you mentioned that.
Nikita Tyukalo: I'm kind of building that out already.
Nikita Tyukalo: You know, software that does exactly that.
Nikita Tyukalo: So it's basically like the dispatching tool for all kinds of you know, in person on site services.
avraham adler: Right as people are doing it manually, we want to do it now.
avraham adler: It's kind of like the Uber Eats structure.
Nikita Tyukalo: Exactly.
Nikita Tyukalo: Something like that.
avraham adler: Perfect.
Nikita Tyukalo: Perfect.
Nikita Tyukalo: Have you seen, have you pulled pulled up the site?
avraham adler: Oh I'm trying to look at the here this page.
avraham adler: Once you look at the aerial things that he constructed and he could potentially join also his team and he has like another 6, 7 developers in the Philippines around that.

avraham adler: Prep works that eats your week automated by someone who's been in your chair finding gold and financial complexity.
avraham adler: Where others see chaos, we see opportunity.
avraham adler: So all service based up, you know and education is something I haven't tapped into, I don't really have experience with there but I have people that do.
avraham adler: Yeah, education is like one of the things, the only component that I'm missing, I feel like oh well we can.
Nikita Tyukalo: Do, we can just do learning for info products.
Nikita Tyukalo: We can start with courses and then scale up from there and then into like a education AI teacher platform from there and then we can partner with to get accredited as like an online university is like kind of ridiculously easy once you have your curriculum verified so you can branch out into like college courses and college credit and partnering with American universities after that we can build like you know a K to 12 education platform but we can start with just making money online courses and then build and branch out into that.
avraham adler: Yeah, that's, that's amazing.
avraham adler: And then like integrate into smart boards, stuff like that.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
avraham adler: Can you talk Shane?
+44 775* ****85: No, I can't talk.
avraham adler: Oh, there you go.
avraham adler: Finally your voice.
avraham adler: Shane, this is the development team that's going to be creating everything.
avraham adler: I wanted to introduce you and, and you should also run through the ideas and your background and what your vision is for the labs components.
avraham adler: I mean we kind of been chopping it up and talking, you know all the sectors that we want to address.
avraham adler: But yes, you're online.
avraham adler: So here we are.
+44 775* ****85: Okay.
+44 775* ****85: So my name is Shane Fox in medicine.
+44 775* ****85: I have a degree in medicine, investment law, investment management.
+44 775* ****85: I've just passed my SR SSP Peptides course, written papers for this.
+44 775* ****85: I've been royal family.
+44 775* ****85: Now I work in the gold sector solely pretty much not being together.
+44 775* ****85: The only person that's really completed real gold deals.
+44 775* ****85: Monday I become the signature for the Chinese dynasty.
+44 775* ****85: 1.1 million metric tons of gold everywhere.
+44 775* ****85: But my medical background, I've never stopped reading genetics, allopathic medicine is dead.
+44 775* ****85: The western world, the petrochemical medicine.
+44 775* ****85: So we discussed developing peptides.
+44 775* ****85: I've designed a water that is not on the market that biohacks your bodies.
+44 775* ****85: Now biohacking sounds a bit scary but simply it changes your intracellular activity back to state one.
+44 775* ****85: So back to its junior new state.
+44 775* ****85: The medical side is I want to start bringing into dropping centers or pay as you go instead of your very over expensive healthcare system.
avraham adler: And we want to implement that into the health centers that we're talking about.
+44 775* ****85: Where the med beds.
+44 775* ****85: Now everybody says there are med beds everywhere but they do a fraction of what the real, real World War II med beds do.
+44 775* ****85: Now be this or not, the real med beds were active.
+44 775* ****85: I think it's three or four in the world and actually regrow Organs.
+44 775* ****85: And obviously it's not an overnight thing, but when you talk about something like copd, where people cannot actually physically walk because of their nerve transition, the man in sheath of the muscle has been completely destroyed.
+44 775* ****85: They have two hours in this machine and they can walk.
+44 775* ****85: I've seen it.
+44 775* ****85: It's scary.
+44 775* ****85: And also I'd like to bring in Stan Cell because I have access to the, to the number one.
+44 775* ****85: She's just won the number one geneticist award in the world.
+44 775* ****85: Now this, this girl only does MSC michikimal, which is just MSC stem cells.
avraham adler: Right?
avraham adler: Sorry, you're talking about Shannon.
+44 775* ****85: No, no, no, you don't know this one, Dr. B.
+44 775* ****85: Okay, so she.
+44 775* ****85: So what, what MSC stem cell will do is after two weeks they'll simply repair any internal injuries.
+44 775* ****85: And then we can back that up with the peptide list that we've got.
+44 775* ****85: And obviously I was talking.
+44 775* ****85: Me and Abby talk quite a lot and discussing the ideas around peptides and people that don't make injections.
+44 775* ****85: So I have a lab here at home where I'm now I've created different mixes on a hexapeptide.
+44 775* ****85: All a hexapeptide is a peptide that will bind to different peptides that are on the same spectrum that will not reduce efficacy.
+44 775* ****85: So I can put together for you a full fat slimming peptide that will not only work on the IGF1 cell, I can work on the IGF1, IGF3 visceral fat.
+44 775* ****85: I can put all this into one mix.
+44 775* ****85: And for example, injuries.
+44 775* ****85: I broke my shoulder.
+44 775* ****85: And by the way, and people, people always say, oh, you know, peptide this I've tried, I have tried on myself every peptide, even the female ones, just to make sure that obviously I don't get.
+44 775* ****85: There's no reactions or anything.
+44 775* ****85: So I broke my shoulder in October things.
+44 775* ****85: And I was 24 on the motorbike and on a 432 stroke on a racetrack.
+44 775* ****85: And I'm going up a tabletop, 88 second power band.
+44 775* ****85: I went about 20, 30 foot.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: I had time to jump off the bike, put the bike to one side, so it landed in the head.
+44 775* ****85: I landed on my shoulder, got private bed in England, went for mri, didn't show anything.
+44 775* ****85: I literally went into Parkinson state after no benzodiazepine.
+44 775* ****85: We can't have a benzodiazepine prescribed because of addiction.
+44 775* ****85: But all I wanted to exploit is when I get low in terms of no sleep and things.
+44 775* ****85: I was going to Lego bags in shape.
+44 775* ****85: It was scary.
+44 775* ****85: So I knew that I had just some medical Knowledge I either got a nerve trap after the carpal tunnel syndrome which is in your wrist and got an o and the C6 at the back of my neck.
+44 775* ****85: As time went on it went into a right arm.
+44 775* ****85: So that means I'm not meeting the carpal tunnel stretching my neck and I've got damage in the shoulder.
+44 775* ****85: I took two weeks of peptides.
+44 775* ****85: I was back in the gym after three weeks.
+44 775* ****85: No pain, zero pain.
+44 775* ****85: So if you watch the best, I always say to Everybody just take five minutes out and just Google Go on YouTube and type in the Wolverine protocol.
+44 775* ****85: So the film, the film Wolverine, he always obviously gets bashed up and things.
+44 775* ****85: Then he goes into Wolverine Protocol and he comes out brand new.
+44 775* ****85: That's basically TB 500 TP 500 and VPC 157.
+44 775* ****85: There you go.
Nikita Tyukalo: So one thing I wanted to do as soon as possible was actually launch an E commerce brand based on peptides and then have it branded with a doctor's speaking on it.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, no, no, no no.
+44 775* ****85: Don't, don't, don't run with doctors because.
+44 775* ****85: Okay, because, because of the cost of prescription.
avraham adler: We want brand.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh no, no no.
Nikita Tyukalo: Because of cost of prescription.
Nikita Tyukalo: But we would, we would have it like, like we would partner with the doctor.
Nikita Tyukalo: So it would like, it would be.
+44 775* ****85: Don't need to, don't need to.
+44 775* ****85: So I have, I have one of the guys, Alex University runs a biotech in, runs in China.
+44 775* ****85: Okay So so he sends me cost wise.
+44 775* ****85: So I'll give you an example.
+44 775* ****85: So Oxford peptides will sell you 5mg of copper peptide for $40.
+44 775* ****85: I can buy 400mg or $60 direct from the source.
+44 775* ****85: And, and he's a friend of mine.
avraham adler: Jason and he has access to the Botox and all those.
avraham adler: What's the shot that makes you lose fat?
avraham adler: GPT.
+44 775* ****85: If you really want to deep down people that are on human growth hormone.
+44 775* ****85: So human growth hormone just quickly go over it is, is a 191 peptide.
+44 775* ****85: All that simply means it's got 191amino acids to make the 191.
+44 775* ****85: Now there's a lot of 90 of the copies out there.
+44 775* ****85: They use a pig, a pig bacteria to make it which makes it 192.
+44 775* ****85: So the efficacy in the body is about 40%.
+44 775* ****85: So my, my friend, he, he will make a one nine one HCA send it to me in bulk at about $45.
+44 775* ****85: 100 for 100 I use as Pfizer 32 IU pen in America is $280.
+44 775* ****85: So what we do is this is the way around it.
+44 775* ****85: So we'd have to go to no doctors, no prescriptions, no nothing.
+44 775* ****85: We do a drop ship into wherever we're based.
+44 775* ****85: I've got the guy that will do all our labels and things and he spent 60 grand on this machine.
+44 775* ****85: It's the best labeling machine ever because it give QRS fingerprinting.
+44 775* ****85: So it takes to where you're gonna go on your phone, on our app and things like that.
+44 775* ****85: So we drop ship and what we say, what you, what you.
+44 775* ****85: Actually the wording in the UK we can buy.
+44 775* ****85: Well you can, you can buy them as well.
+44 775* ****85: You can buy a peptide on Amazon.
+44 775* ****85: And the reason why you get around it is for research purpose only.
+44 775* ****85: We don't give any medical.
+44 775* ****85: We don't give any medical advice.
+44 775* ****85: Yes, we do it in a very clever way.
+44 775* ****85: But we drop ship and we are in conjunction with the major universities in the uk, Oxford.
Nikita Tyukalo: So we have university.
Nikita Tyukalo: Perfect.
Nikita Tyukalo: Perfect.
+44 775* ****85: And if the FDA really want to deep dive into your ass.
+44 775* ****85: Listen, you're not going to get any doctor in Oxford University.
+44 775* ****85: You try and call that university.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, unfortunately I'm still friends with my, the doctor that when I was at university.
+44 775* ****85: Really good.
+44 775* ****85: He's serious now obviously, but he's quite old.
+44 775* ****85: But he, but he was, he was so, so far forward thinking dating them.
+44 775* ****85: That allopathic medicine is dead because there's no allopathic medicine on the market that will actually cure you.
+44 775* ****85: This is the reason why the Rothschilds and all these families, whichever family it is, are absolutely just milking it through chemotherapy which is not needed.
+44 775* ****85: Cancer, for example.
avraham adler: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: You'll see parasites causing the majority.
Nikita Tyukalo: But then the culture around deworming is.
Nikita Tyukalo: Or you know, similar is not even present in the West.
Nikita Tyukalo: Things like that just.
+44 775* ****85: Well, exactly.
+44 775* ****85: Do you know why?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes.
+44 775* ****85: The fda.
+44 775* ****85: The fda and I was trying to have it.
+44 775* ****85: The FDA canceled the prescription.
+44 775* ****85: The prescription of three.
+44 775* ****85: Three medications.
+44 775* ****85: Ivermectin and.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, they canceled Ivermectin completely.
+44 775* ****85: They did it 10 years ago.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, I see.
Nikita Tyukalo: Before they started doing all the bioweapons.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, I understand.
+44 775* ****85: Yes.
+44 775* ****85: You know why?
+44 775* ****85: Because it works.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: And once every year I take a full course of every one of these because I, I'm a great believer in prevention is better than cure.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes, that's true.
+44 775* ****85: But we got a.
+44 775* ****85: If we had a friend and as you said, he got pre cancerous cells.
+44 775* ****85: Pre cancerous cells.
+44 775* ****85: I mean they make me laugh when they say stage four.
+44 775* ****85: Right.
+44 775* ****85: If it's on a stage four Stage side, where is it?
+44 775* ****85: It's all over your body.
+44 775* ****85: Is that why you call it stage four of stage five because you're giving chemotherapy?
+44 775* ****85: So think about chemotherapy.
+44 775* ****85: If I'm taking a cell that's bound in tight, then I'm filling it with water to make it then, then it's walls are then available for osmosis and diffusion to pass by.
+44 775* ****85: What's that cancer going to do once I go into chemotherapy?
+44 775* ****85: Just jump from one cell to another.
+44 775* ****85: So easy metastasized.
avraham adler: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: The two ways I, I've got friend, the, the guy I'm going to see, I'm going to spend two days in the next ten days in London.
+44 775* ****85: He's just opened out of his own pocket with Dr. V, their own MSC stem cell hospital.
+44 775* ****85: And there's another, there's another, there's another stem cell called rgf.
+44 775* ****85: Now this is not to say that we're trying to use it as a, as a money spender because we all want to make money.
+44 775* ****85: But what this IGS does, it'll take it four weeks.
+44 775* ****85: Treatment of this will take your biological age about 20 years.
Nikita Tyukalo: Wow.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: So you know all you start and all that, don't want to drop in that, don't want to fly to Chile and things like that.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: But all you do is you create like my, I have a, I have a macious trust for my son's money and things like that that I run through through a Mauritius bank.
+44 775* ****85: I have a bear trust in front of it so there's no name on it.
+44 775* ****85: And then I run it through the foundation bank so I can, I can make in any, any jurisdiction.
+44 775* ****85: But I also have Shariah Law on there so I can have my MBD bank in, in.
+44 775* ****85: So if anybody comes, you're chasing, you're chasing shadows.
+44 775* ****85: And this is, this is where Google.
+44 775* ****85: So you'll know more about this than me probably because it's America.
+44 775* ****85: It's called a 508 corporation.
+44 775* ****85: Now there is something that's just come out which I need to find out.
+44 775* ****85: I need to get the, I need to get the name of it.
+44 775* ****85: They're saying that this new, this new, let's call it 509, it makes you untouchable from every authority.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh.
+44 775* ****85: So now you talk about top layering.
+44 775* ****85: You wrap yourself around that.
+44 775* ****85: We have Navi, rv, Javier, you know, whatever you want to do and roll the channel.
+44 775* ****85: And the only reason why I want to roll med bed now and the MSC stands on this because MSC stands on the sewage in the UK is it's Way back north because they want to control what they do want to do.
+44 775* ****85: Now what we want to do is get doctors in and say, right, we can get five patients in today, tomorrow, and then we can get the mad bed then we can get 10 in today because the med bed is only an hour session and then the peptide.
+44 775* ****85: So all we're doing is, is the new medical world where we are, we are not working.
+44 775* ****85: It's a neck in the neck.
+44 775* ****85: So if you look at your body is an external source.
+44 775* ****85: We're targeting everything at cellular level and intracellular level exactly like, like peptides.
+44 775* ****85: I mean AB Day 1.
+44 775* ****85: I love these.
+44 775* ****85: And I'm gonna not.
+44 775* ****85: Well, I've just got a minute.
+44 775* ****85: I'm going to send Abby over.
+44 775* ****85: So I've designed a well being peptides and all it is is copper.
+44 775* ****85: NAD plus copper.
Nikita Tyukalo: You take copper as well for the heart?
+44 775* ****85: Not for the heart.
+44 775* ****85: Every single, for every single cell in your body.
+44 775* ****85: Copper.
+44 775* ****85: It's scary.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: Copper as well stops gray hairs.
+44 775* ****85: Stops what?
Nikita Tyukalo: Copper as well stops looking great.
Nikita Tyukalo: Really?
+44 775* ****85: Oh, I mean, no, but, no but listen.
+44 775* ****85: So that comes down to genetics.
+44 775* ****85: So yeah, a lot of people have.
Nikita Tyukalo: A copper deficiency with which.
Nikita Tyukalo: Which makes.
Nikita Tyukalo: Some people have the copper deficiency which also affects early gray hair and then also the heart.
Nikita Tyukalo: So they need extra copper even younger to stop the gray hair.
Nikita Tyukalo: Younger.
+44 775* ****85: And then let me tell you now the healthiest person in the world needs copper still because the cellular.
+44 775* ****85: So you have.
+44 775* ****85: So when you look at the rg, the IGS sensor therapy, it simply goes around your body for all your.
+44 775* ****85: Let's just say just for aging, just for a purpose that we all understand what we're on the same call just for the ages outside.
+44 775* ****85: And it literally killed, it killed all the cells in the dead cells first.
+44 775* ****85: Because the problem with dead cells going on your body is they still remain in within the.
+44 775* ****85: So I've got 100, I've got an army of hundreds, but I've only got 25 active soldiers.
+44 775* ****85: I've got 75 that can't do anything.
+44 775* ****85: But you still travel as a unit because that's what the brain tells the body to do.
+44 775* ****85: That's why peptide is also good.
+44 775* ****85: But what this does, it kills all the cells and then makes it 25 back up to 100 in a few weeks.
+44 775* ****85: So they did a test, I got the test.
+44 775* ****85: I got the test tape as well.
+44 775* ****85: They did a test on the guy and when I looked at him, I thought this guy's 52.
+44 775* ****85: He was 72.
+44 775* ****85: Right.
+44 775* ****85: And it took, it took, it took his age back to 36.
+44 775* ****85: Did he actually see the guy?
+44 775* ****85: Europe sir.
+44 775* ****85: Hello.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, well yeah if actually see the guy you'll say he's not, he's Nowhere, nowhere near 72.
+44 775* ****85: Complete rejuvenation of the, of the, of the epidemic.
+44 775* ****85: Epidemia wall of the skin cells, getting rid of every, all the dead cells, rejuvenating the dermis, rejuvenating heart function.
+44 775* ****85: And again what, what if you think about the med bed, the MSC stem cell, the rgb, they all then leave with a packet of, with a box of peptides because the peptide that we in the, we've got labia.
+44 775* ****85: I've got a range of fixed peptides and the efficacy of them is at 98% so I'm in one which is copper Ms.
+44 775* ****85: Sorry Moxie.
+44 775* ****85: So the moxie peptide is one of the ones that's not really taken to the market yet because they don't really know what it is.
+44 775* ****85: But every single energy confirmation in your body whether, whether it's just going to the toilet or whether it's going for five 5k run your, your, your ATP, your ATP cycle, you know that's only the person for the adenose triphosphate to make, to make energy.
+44 775* ****85: But that will also start through a cell called mitochondria.
+44 775* ****85: But what happens as you get even post 28 in the mitochondria that they start dying around the body.
+44 775* ****85: The must see peptide comes in like an army, finds all it goes.
+44 775* ****85: Because the best thing I always say about peptides is they're all maculate, they're already in your body.
+44 775* ****85: Just change the amino acids that have been, that have been recently made and I'm going to put it back in.
+44 775* ****85: So if I put something.
+44 775* ****85: So if I put heart peptide in my body, my brain said straight away send this to the heart.
+44 775* ****85: I don't have to go through the gut, I don't have to go through the stomach acid, I don't have to go through the kidneys or the liver or anything like that which where western medicine.
+44 775* ****85: I was laughing since I'm funny.
+44 775* ****85: They've met a medic, they've met a medication now for some cancer and they've had to double wrap it because it's that, it's that horrible in the stomach.
+44 775* ****85: A double layer.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, I mean, I mean come on, seriously, you've not got all the brain to say my mom looks and I said oh I'm not good at my dumb.
+44 775* ****85: No, it's not good.
+44 775* ****85: That means if she need to put something in your body, that's.
Nikita Tyukalo: It'S.
+44 775* ****85: Not even mapped.
+44 775* ****85: That's why peptides come so, so that's why we lyfe Peptides so we keep them in the original state.
+44 775* ****85: And now I've designed so nobody likes injection.
+44 775* ****85: So now I've designed the full range through an asil.
+44 775* ****85: That's the only two ways you can get.
Nikita Tyukalo: We have the life Elizabeth divisions as well.
Nikita Tyukalo: For the orals for BPC we also.
avraham adler: Wanted to tackle the glasses industry.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, cool.
Nikita Tyukalo: Glass.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah we can do that.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh low cost glasses up to the masses or what?
Nikita Tyukalo: What, what, what you said you want.
avraham adler: To do lenses, right?
+44 775* ****85: Oh no, I've got.
+44 775* ****85: No, just another one.
+44 775* ****85: I've got, I've got a friend that's got a company called Crazy Lenses.
+44 775* ****85: Google it.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
+44 775* ****85: He is his market in America.
+44 775* ****85: He is making just, just take Halloween for example.
+44 775* ****85: Making millions.
+44 775* ****85: But when I put, when I put to him I want, I want a part of your company for free.
+44 775* ****85: And we'll just do all his own advertising.
+44 775* ****85: We'll take care of his company access.
avraham adler: To generators and really really earth shattering scientific things.
avraham adler: So again Shane, like you see I aligned with people that are in the commodity space and have financial and construction know how and background and also a value add in terms of other you know, sectors.
+44 775* ****85: This is what I like.
+44 775* ****85: This is so what I mean what I like with Abby is that even though I will be concentrating on medicine and but when I start talking to people and they say oh I need money, I need, well I need because you always get talking to patients and oh I've got this mortgage problem, I need a car, blah blah blah, you then you just, you just add into the spider blood when you go to they give us some rock or is under our umbrella you'll get a preferential 5% whatever, 2% whatever off.
+44 775* ****85: And because like I've been saying there I am financial, I was a financial director for the biggest UK in chartered investment management company.
+44 775* ****85: So I could tell you about that.
+44 775* ****85: They're saying to me oh yeah go go now go.
+44 775* ****85: See anything else?
avraham adler: His alliances and people that he has relationships with are people that have IPS and you know, transacts and have know how and et cetera experience.
avraham adler: And again not all but we're gonna have to sit down and really chop it up and see who's wearing, you know something, I'm going to be advisors.
avraham adler: Some are going to be you know actually equity shares but obviously the ones that come with the most assets and the value add, you know goes into the core of course and then there's Going to be.
avraham adler: That's, that's really going to be the hardest part, if you will, because obviously there's a lot of people that we could use.
avraham adler: Utilize, not use.
avraham adler: I don't like that word, but you know what I mean.
avraham adler: And then allocations, what is fair?
Nikita Tyukalo: What is fair?
avraham adler: Like how much commission for how long and what grading scale.
avraham adler: And I want to always leave legacy and then again always like 10 to 20 to charity for a trust fund and all that.
avraham adler: So all those intricate details, once we identify who are going to be the core team, which as far as I know so far as Maz, myself, Shane, John and Yurga, Nikita, because he's, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but he, he's the one who bankrolls you and operations.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, he owns his modeling agency.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then when we kind of network with each other.
+44 775* ****85: So you know John, who you spoke to Yesterday about the 30 million barrels of Jet One, he's linked to Trump's number two for the DOD.
+44 775* ****85: So he will give.
+44 775* ****85: He is such a good guy.
+44 775* ****85: Such a, such a good guy.
+44 775* ****85: And we speak on the daily about what we can do, what we can't do.
+44 775* ****85: I've got a call on Monday with the water rollout with the government.
Nikita Tyukalo: Of.
+44 775* ****85: The US to, to, to actually roll this out.
+44 775* ****85: But what I do like about what we're doing is, is don't put 20.
+44 775* ****85: But you know, start looking at.
+44 775* ****85: Obviously I told you that what I.
avraham adler: Was saying is every SPV is gonna, is gonna recognize the value of the, of, of what the assets are worth plus the cash flow if they have and if they don't and appropriate it accordingly into the SPV and the distribution flow into holding company allocation based on what that worth is.
+44 775* ****85: Yes.
avraham adler: And those people are gonna have those seats with the equity distribution and options and whatnot.
avraham adler: And of course voting chairs to have come, you know, not as a dictatorship, but togetherness as a shared vision.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, this was, this is another thing I got to every point he put himself down at 25, it's his baby.
avraham adler: I mean that's just back of envelope.
avraham adler: I'm not there.
+44 775* ****85: I'm just, I'm just saying to them, everybody around the table still got to say, you're not at the end of the table saying dictates.
+44 775* ****85: This is yoga.
+44 775* ****85: This.
+44 775* ****85: I've got, I've got access to a guy in the, in the UK now and what he does, he gives for every year of school he gives out scholarships fully paid for top, top education for people who are not fortunate enough to.
+44 775* ****85: We don't have projects in, in the uk but there are some various poor areas but there's some very, very bright people and you love the fact that these people get a chance but with that chance have they got sporting ability that we can monopolize and, and you know that's what he does, he brings, he produced.
+44 775* ****85: So my son who just signed pro football his year, so there's, there's only 20 per class that that year produced five academy football players just.
+44 775* ****85: But the difference of, of how you treat your sports people to compare how we drag out through the, in the day, it's, it's embarrassing.
+44 775* ****85: You know I went to, I was fortunate when I played in the MLS.
+44 775* ****85: I was in Revolution.
+44 775* ****85: We had like a AAA side and we played Boston University.
+44 775* ****85: There was 35,000 people turn up.
+44 775* ****85: I was just like what the world.
+44 775* ****85: Just to, just to again refine.
+44 775* ****85: That was like we don't get this a university game where we, we play at home.
+44 775* ****85: You get 500 funds and all because the students, the model, the model and the way that how the American think is, it's, it's, that's why where the most of the outliers and the entrepreneurial people come from because they've got the freedom to actually do this.
+44 775* ****85: But what's happening now is with all the Gates and the Trump and the Ross child is that's getting squeezed from them and taken from them connection.
+44 775* ****85: Sorry, is there a lady on the call?
avraham adler: Yeah, I can hear you.
avraham adler: What's up?
avraham adler: Just texting John.
avraham adler: What's up?
avraham adler: Hello.
avraham adler: Yeah, we're here.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, sorry, we just had one of the models asking us a question.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: But no, we're definitely if we can launch actually even the, the Peptides.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, it's gonna be easy.
avraham adler: But again that's also going to be part of the plan.
avraham adler: How we roll it out, how we start from where, how we implement, where we execute.
+44 775* ****85: Not only that, I've got a guy in products can actually roll us out at percent on the dollar that we don't have to put no work in whatsoever.
+44 775* ****85: Let's call it Navi.
+44 775* ****85: Navi vitamins right on the shelf.
+44 775* ****85: That gives you multivitamins, mental health vitamins, sleep vitamins, female vitamins.
+44 775* ****85: We'll have all this range.
+44 775* ****85: There's no ranges on the shelf.
+44 775* ****85: I'm thinking why what.
+44 775* ****85: So this guy in India that I've got now is a chase.
+44 775* ****85: I will make all these for you, brand you them perfect brand in perfect boxes and you're paying five cents for a box.
+44 775* ****85: I'm like, wow, India.
+44 775* ****85: Welcome To India.
+44 775* ****85: Welcome to the uk.
+44 775* ****85: Which you pound just for the box, the weapon.
+44 775* ****85: We're paying 80 cents, 60 cents for these vitamins.
+44 775* ****85: We've got them on the shelf at $3 in all the wellness centers all labeled up.
+44 775* ****85: And then we've got dropping centers like in the world of centers for, for health.
+44 775* ****85: Because we don't, we are not doctors, but we'll give you advice that you know, when I say something, you've got almost two injury.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: VPC, VPC 157, low dose TV time limit, overload dose.
+44 775* ****85: But I can put those two together, right, with copper and NAD plus.
+44 775* ****85: So what you've got there is you've got your NAD that runs your, your cerebral hemispheres that make them maximize the hormonal output and you've got your moon lap for the, for the fit in and I guess what GB and repeated, they do that.
+44 775* ****85: But then you've got copper fly around clearing up and make sure everything's all right.
Nikita Tyukalo: And there's a, there's some herbs for HGH as well with like quite a large.
Nikita Tyukalo: Obviously if you have them taking MK677 as well to boost the ghrelin and boost the growth hormone, that can boost it as well.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then.
+44 775* ****85: I'm not.
+44 775* ****85: I'm going to tell you the truth now.
+44 775* ****85: You can.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, but you're talking, you're talking minuscule percentages.
+44 775* ****85: It's just a play on the market and I'll tell you why, really.
Nikita Tyukalo: I've experienced quite like good healing off of MK677.
+44 775* ****85: No, no, no, no, no, the peptide, yes.
+44 775* ****85: But what I'm saying to it is before that there was a lot of bs, Western medicine that says we can, we can improve your mk.
+44 775* ****85: Listen, MK in the serious point player.
+44 775* ****85: So that's one of the.
+44 775* ****85: So what I do it.
+44 775* ****85: So again, so now you're talking.
+44 775* ****85: So what I do with anti 670 is put that with some proper HGH because it supports the input of HGH and keeps it at its maximum.
+44 775* ****85: But if you look at.
+44 775* ****85: So if you doctor me and read research papers all the time, there's an HCH there out there called HGH 175 to 191.
+44 775* ****85: So if you look at this, if you look at.
+44 775* ****85: Yes.
+44 775* ****85: If you look at a dinner on your table that you're going to eat, there's so many components of.
+44 775* ****85: You've got vegetables, you've got your, you've got your vitamins and things there, you've got your meat, your proteins, what all they've done is they've spliced the HGH take off the fat burn inside and that is all HGH1 175 and 191 will do.
+44 775* ****85: No muscle growth, no nothing, just fat burn.
+44 775* ****85: So what we do is is we, we give people the tazepatide semaglutide peptide to, to take as much weight as you can off in 4 fat but then it needs to come back and I want you to take a course of 175 to 191 because what, what that does is if you put that into an overloaded state of body you have to keep putting more and more and because the body's big obviously.
+44 775* ****85: But what we want to do is just get you from I don't know, you've lost your 19 pounds, your target was 20.
+44 775* ****85: That's what, that's where 175191 comes in.
+44 775* ****85: There's just so many variations that we can do.
+44 775* ****85: But what we're going to do, we want to start with a mental health one a well being one an injury one.
+44 775* ****85: This is the biggest the injury well you know it the tbc, tbc, BP and copy together in the nasal that we can produce and we can tell them what to do every day because nobody wants to keep putting the needle in every day and three needles and blah blah blah.
+44 775* ****85: If, if we do that it takes away every single western medicine from and from I do prefer non steroid anti inflammatories to the proxy center.
+44 775* ****85: Every single medical company it takes out all their use.
+44 775* ****85: And this is the problem that it may face where somebody big at the FDA is going to come and say bump.
+44 775* ****85: So, so me being obviously from where I am I'm like well they're flying, they're flying in England, they're flying through Europe, they're flying in America but they're flying under the radar of the, of the, in the doctor's prescription.
+44 775* ****85: But what we also can purchase when we've got some money, I think it's about $300,000 is an actual IP doctor prescription writer and my friend used it for his, for his contact lenses because he started off doing contact lenses colored scary Halloween blah blah blah blah blah.
+44 775* ****85: And then stewards take description and, and they're calling at the same time and he bought this link up.
+44 775* ****85: It's meant to be, it's sold as linked to a proper optical doctor.
+44 775* ****85: Let's say for example no mate, if, if I could put somebody's name and address and their Social Security number Print it out straight away.
+44 775* ****85: You can't tell that that's a link up to anything, but it's.
+44 775* ****85: But if you've got that on your wall, you're covered.
Nikita Tyukalo: No, definitely.
+44 775* ****85: So.
+44 775* ****85: So the peptide is.
+44 775* ****85: I'm over studies on the peptide side.
+44 775* ****85: What I'm just working on now.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, different.
+44 775* ****85: Different mixes because there's some really good ones.
+44 775* ****85: I mean, you've mentioned this, the mk that's taking a bit of a back step now because the new things that are coming out.
+44 775* ****85: So this is where, when, when Abby was saying, I said, listen, I'll bring the best two or three peptide doctors into, into the unit and we can't get them from the us, unfortunately, China and the uk, I think us.
avraham adler: You need to have like a prescription or something.
avraham adler: I was told.
+44 775* ****85: Yes, that's right, that's what I'm saying.
+44 775* ****85: And how much is the prescription in the us?
+44 775* ****85: Sorry, Astrocy, how much is the prescription in the us?
avraham adler: I didn't, she didn't answer me, really.
avraham adler: I didn't get.
avraham adler: Oh, for.
Nikita Tyukalo: Wait for prescription glasses.
+44 775* ****85: No, no, no, no, no.
+44 775* ****85: If I go to the doctors and I. I don't see if I go to the Doctors.
+44 775* ****85: In the UK, a prescription is $20.
+44 775* ****85: No matter.
+44 775* ****85: So you pay for your prescription, you get your medicine.
+44 775* ****85: How much is it in the US?
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, $50.
+44 775* ****85: So you've got this healthcare system and then you have to pay for your prescription.
+44 775* ****85: How up is that?
+44 775* ****85: But what I do, what, what America definitely does need, and this is me looking and being on the inside is a really good dropping center where I've got a bit of a look at now again, starts with coccus, there's one I forgot, but it works on atrial fibrillation.
+44 775* ****85: Now it doesn't get rid of your afib, but what it does, it makes sure that your SA node that, that fires, that causes afib can work as its maximum ability.
+44 775* ****85: Whilst you are still here, just say so would you rather have an operation and something inserted into your body that you have to make sure there's patches and blah, blah, blah.
+44 775* ****85: It's on the male side of my family.
+44 775* ****85: My.
+44 775* ****85: My uncle collapsed on me on the squash.
+44 775* ****85: Clothing died and it was, it's.
+44 775* ****85: That was the start of the atrium in our family.
+44 775* ****85: So then again, what do I do?
+44 775* ****85: Deep dive into research.
+44 775* ****85: Everyone's got diabetes.
+44 775* ****85: All these things can be become.
+44 775* ****85: So can be stopped, can be caught.
+44 775* ****85: It can.
+44 775* ****85: Can be stopped at source by simple allopathic.
+44 775* ****85: So for example, cancer.
+44 775* ****85: You were saying, do you know, if you go.
+44 775* ****85: If you fast for 14 days.
Nikita Tyukalo: Of course, you'll clear your entire body.
avraham adler: The autophagy.
+44 775* ****85: Thank you.
+44 775* ****85: Thank you.
+44 775* ****85: I mean, people look at me and laugh.
+44 775* ****85: I don't talk to people anymore.
+44 775* ****85: I just.
+44 775* ****85: People have been just absolutely dipped, washed, mental, brainwashed into going to the doctor.
+44 775* ****85: So my mum's friend, she just got.
+44 775* ****85: She just had a third stroke.
+44 775* ****85: She had nine injections of anti vac.
+44 775* ****85: So she had nine vaccinations.
+44 775* ****85: Oh, my question is this, My question is this about any medicine before you, Before I do it?
+44 775* ****85: Tell me what's in there before I put it in my body.
Nikita Tyukalo: Exactly.
+44 775* ****85: I met my own stuff.
+44 775* ****85: I didn't know this.
+44 775* ****85: I met my own storage.
+44 775* ****85: I met my own steroids from, from in our lab and we are probably the biggest.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, wow.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, we spoke to Mr. Olympia.
+44 775* ****85: I didn't know this because I don't really talk because people have got a very sad look on this.
+44 775* ****85: But you know, steroids play such an important role in.
+44 775* ****85: So HRT is probably one of the biggest sellers in the US and the uk, but it's.
+44 775* ****85: It's either a tablet that has to go through the guts or the ethic is the efficacy has already lost 25.
+44 775* ****85: I don't care what you say, because of the acid in the stomach.
+44 775* ****85: But also they do a topical skin cream.
+44 775* ****85: Your skin is waterproof for a reason.
+44 775* ****85: So, so just take, just take 50 milligrams, right, of injectable testosterone every week if you pass the age of 30, 35.
+44 775* ****85: And I do it and I do that and it keeps me.
+44 775* ****85: It keeps me absolutely prime.
Nikita Tyukalo: Is the hormone.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's necessary, it's necessary past a certain age.
Nikita Tyukalo: Unless you're running other, like enclomophen or something.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
+44 775* ****85: But what I'm saying is I went to see.
+44 775* ****85: So I went up to the lab yesterday and I said, look, let's talk more.
+44 775* ****85: We can link to him, but he won't be a navi old or anything like that.
+44 775* ****85: But it's a branch we can have for the bodybuilding world in the US for a drop.
+44 775* ****85: He'll drop everything in.
+44 775* ****85: So for every 35 that he says, we'll get $10 back into the Navy because we don't want to be.
+44 775* ****85: Unfortunately, the American market doesn't want to be seen selling steroids, but the amount he's sending is.
+44 775* ****85: He's doing about 35,000.
avraham adler: Yeah, I heard another kid doing this stuff and they can't be traced or anything.
avraham adler: Yeah, it doesn't.
+44 775* ****85: No, no.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, you'll never trace this.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
+44 775* ****85: It's clever.
+44 775* ****85: But, but I know from doing problems to do medicine and doing.
+44 775* ****85: I set off of this stuff up because obviously my medical background, I say it's tablet press up.
+44 775* ****85: I mean he's doing every.
+44 775* ****85: The good.
+44 775* ****85: I tell you what else is doing which I really, really like is he's finding an oil.
+44 775* ****85: The oils that he uses are so clear they go through an insulin needle.
+44 775* ****85: You don't have to put a 31 gauge needle in your ass which, which hurts by the way.
avraham adler: He also has other things.
avraham adler: There's going to nasal sprays for skin care.
avraham adler: He has a lot of things that are.
+44 775* ****85: Yes, yep.
avraham adler: Yeah.
avraham adler: I mean again, Shane, this was just like a introductory.
avraham adler: I mean anything in terms of what you think of the CRM and implementation.
avraham adler: I shared with them, the AI you know, they're working on the, on the real estate sales type of things.
avraham adler: Been working on the navi main branch.
avraham adler: I gave them the vision, I give them that.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, perfect.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: So did you have any, any thoughts on that?
Nikita Tyukalo: Just the level of detail we can go in for each, for each niche and the ones you're involved in, how you could kind of, I mean he's.
avraham adler: Going to be the Navi labs kind of head.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
avraham adler: Awesome.
avraham adler: So then the implementation and those products that he has with those medical background or whatever he feels that team.
avraham adler: And Shane is not a guy that's going to say hey, I'm in charge of whatever if he has a doctor or professor, whatever he's going to do around me.
avraham adler: Right?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: Because I've got, I've got, I've got.
+44 775* ****85: So Jason.
avraham adler: And plus the, the fact that he has the gold connections and those comments for the commodities and the implementation of the procedures and all the best, safest way for buyers and sellers to have.
+44 775* ****85: A meeting on and the things we all should be working on the same page, selling the same products to everybody really.
+44 775* ****85: But that's the idea because if you do a, the, the RGS stem cell and you make somebody feel like 30 years younger because that's what it does.
+44 775* ****85: That's what it really does.
+44 775* ****85: And they're paying $10,000 just for a drop in.
+44 775* ****85: I mean you can't tell me they've not got a portfolio that needs some investment work from our bankers or once.
avraham adler: We have the money, we're going to have wealth management in private equity in house.
avraham adler: Yeah, it's going to be Blackstone type, you know, like all that but just more realistic and user friendly and for the people, you know.
+44 775* ****85: You just hit the name on the end there.
+44 775* ****85: There is no financial tool out there that is for the people.
+44 775* ****85: It is all.
+44 775* ****85: It's all driven by regulation and what the regulatory body says we've got a company in the UK called oh hell Fisher Investment they'll only talk to you unless you've got 250 000.
+44 775* ****85: Right.
+44 775* ****85: They say they will not fit you in a box.
avraham adler: No but there is such a thing in America as accredited investor and all that.
avraham adler: That's what I'm saying.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah you're feeling in front of us buddy.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: But we.
+44 775* ****85: What I'm saying is what we need is something that is just not off the shelf and just made to be polished in gold when it's dipped in dog.
+44 775* ****85: We need you know we need a bespoke real good advisor that.
+44 775* ****85: That sorry investment team that takes personal care.
+44 775* ****85: As I always say this if you're going to invest money invest it like it's your own.
avraham adler: Right.
+44 775* ****85: So I have zero.
+44 775* ****85: I have zero equity now over the last 10 I've taken mine and my son's money out of his trust.
+44 775* ****85: So I've taken everything off the equity table because I'd be shorting every single market in the world right now.
+44 775* ****85: Yesterday they put all the defense fighter planes and things like that into Dubai.
+44 775* ****85: So something's going seriously down.
avraham adler: Yeah we spoke about this internally ourselves or Ariel that the fact is that the Fiat is around the corner for being extinct.
avraham adler: It's just a war way of a bubble bursting and we want to be poised to have asset backed stable coin that is transacting across all species.
+44 775* ****85: But I always say as well is so if you have a sorry for another stable stable coins which is linked to whichever peg gold or whichever is why not have an individual company cost a Costco coin or a Walmart coin because people are so driven by the the place where they shop where they take a ship and things like this.
+44 775* ****85: I just can't believe that people have not come out with Costco coin because it stores in a call it can be stored in the cold wallet.
+44 775* ****85: It's another.
+44 775* ****85: It's.
+44 775* ****85: It's not on the.
+44 775* ****85: It's not on the metric you only can spend it in in Costco.
+44 775* ****85: And sure I know the value of Costco and I know that they're going to give you some extra on top of it per year and yeah but.
avraham adler: Even other retails I saw Sachs is shutting down like the retail's dead just distribution oh 100.
+44 775* ****85: It'S a drop incentive now Amazon, you know things like this.
+44 775* ****85: But why I'm not going to tell Amazon because we want to do it ourselves.
avraham adler: Yeah.
avraham adler: Just recently also like Tesla, like being direct to consumer, you know, just more user friendly, more caring about the people.
avraham adler: It's the same, you know.
+44 775* ****85: Yes, Yep.
+44 775* ****85: That is, that is the MVP definitely right there, what you just said.
+44 775* ****85: We want, we want to put people first where we don't want to put.
avraham adler: And we want our own verticals.
avraham adler: And again, I didn't tell you my experience when I had the 30 companies, the way I set it up is that every vertical cross like my, like I looked just like that.
avraham adler: Navi is the spearhead of the, of the system that we're implementing.
avraham adler: Let's say that I might had an event platform.
avraham adler: Let's say I ran the Madison Square Garden, I would sell tickets.
avraham adler: So now how can I make money off the event?
avraham adler: I can have my sponsors that are company that are owned by me.
avraham adler: On the fashion show itself, I had the clothing brands that I owned.
avraham adler: In the clothing brands.
avraham adler: I had the model agency in the modeling, she said I had the people who were doing the makeup, you know.
avraham adler: So every single aspect of the vertical, from distribution, from manufacturing, from implementing for marketing, I was paying my companies internally to do it.
avraham adler: So I created my own.
avraham adler: So this is like a revamp of that on a broader horizon with better people that now are more mature and more experienced and went through a humbling, you know, period in my life where I've learned to not care about myself and party and live that stuff, but do it for the betterment of others.
+44 775* ****85: Loving gas and getting bombed.
+44 775* ****85: Love it.
avraham adler: All right, Shane, thank you.
+44 775* ****85: Perfect.
+44 775* ****85: Thank you for your time.
+44 775* ****85: Anytime.
+44 775* ****85: Always, always, if you need me.
+44 775* ****85: Because I've just done no respect for anybody's time frame.
+44 775* ****85: So that's just the way we roll.
avraham adler: Like I said, they're going to do like six to seven months to launch and we're going to start with the exchange and the glow fly and we're going to find that.
+44 775* ****85: So.
avraham adler: Because even with the exchange and the.
Nikita Tyukalo: Glow Fi, what we were just speaking about, you can have creator coins or things like that just for the, for each, I guess entity that wants to exist as part of like a marketing, you know, as part of marketing, but then also, you know, defi aspect of it.
avraham adler: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: What I would do for the coin is I'd have a Navy stable coin, but then I'd have a utility coin for each sector that uses that Navi coin.
+44 775* ****85: So all the utility coin does, it backs up the stable coin, but it has no real value until it comes back to navi so.
+44 775* ****85: So our companies will they buy a car for 80,000.
+44 775* ****85: They pay 80000 utility coins.
+44 775* ****85: Nobody can break into that wallet or anything until they come back to the.
+44 775* ****85: To the mother base.
+44 775* ****85: My 80000 is taken from the stable.
avraham adler: Coin and then of course cards and you know, utilization and you know.
avraham adler: Yeah, something like.
avraham adler: Like what do you call it?
avraham adler: Revolt or revolut or whatever.
avraham adler: Something like that.
avraham adler: You know, that's a user friendly retail.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, I see.
Nikita Tyukalo: User friendly.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like crypto banking.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes, on ramps.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
avraham adler: The asset base.
avraham adler: So it has stability just like the gold was backing the dollar.
avraham adler: You know, because that's where we'll be printing money essentially.
avraham adler: Because we're just going to be printing USDT cable obviously.
avraham adler: Yeah, it's like tether the treasury.
+44 775* ****85: What?
+44 775* ****85: The treasury.
+44 775* ****85: So what central banking will do is they would dilute.
+44 775* ****85: They will try and dilute the crypto market because they're bringing their own coin out and they're doing it now through King McToon at two and a half million in his two and a half million metric tons of gold.
+44 775* ****85: And for some strange reason Dubai are totally embedded in the US So US dropped all their planes.
+44 775* ****85: And I mean my friend over there, I was sentenced to have you.
+44 775* ****85: I'm telling you bro, he's like my friend saying to me, Shane, they're closing all the main fronts up.
+44 775* ****85: They'll tell you stays in the.
+44 775* ****85: Using their car park for the.
+44 775* ****85: For the machine, for the night.
+44 775* ****85: They put a fighting machine.
+44 775* ****85: I'm like, wow.
+44 775* ****85: If it happens in Dubai, it happens everywhere.
+44 775* ****85: Trust me.
+44 775* ****85: But Saturday is a new divide.
avraham adler: Okay, so let me one thing I.
Nikita Tyukalo: Wanted to add as well because I wanted you to speak Abraham.
Nikita Tyukalo: I had an old crypto connect.
Nikita Tyukalo: I worked it did a little bit of work with him back in the day.
Nikita Tyukalo: But he has access to a lot of Saudi money.
avraham adler: Yeah, trust me, I know.
avraham adler: I transact in the BTC.
avraham adler: That's where I started in BTC secondary market.
avraham adler: That's where I'm getting the 50 billion from.
avraham adler: I told you, Chan.
avraham adler: Zach.
avraham adler: I also have a seller of about a million BTCs.
avraham adler: That's streamlining.
avraham adler: I have two, three Lois out for BTC seller and another transacting probably on the 22nd face to face.
avraham adler: So I got that.
avraham adler: And I know the people who implemented.
avraham adler: I know Tether, Brock Pierce, wife Mari is my good friend from 10 years.
avraham adler: You know Reeves.
avraham adler: I know.
avraham adler: We got that.
+44 775* ****85: And you know Tom.
avraham adler: Yeah, and Tom, remember?
avraham adler: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: But he wants me to be focused.
avraham adler: You know, all that.
+44 775* ****85: The problem with someone is this.
avraham adler: He's kind of.
avraham adler: What's the word?
+44 775* ****85: No, the problem.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: If he gets an idea himself, he doesn't want to run with anything else.
+44 775* ****85: I'm just like, tommy, you need to.
+44 775* ****85: You need to open your eyes a little bit.
avraham adler: Right?
avraham adler: He's not a big picture.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's like.
avraham adler: He's a vc.
avraham adler: Underwriting, risk management portfolio, that stuff.
+44 775* ****85: Oh, I know that.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, but the guys.
+44 775* ****85: Listen, the guy was great.
avraham adler: I told him, get an advisory.
avraham adler: Okay.
avraham adler: There's a guy, Jonathan Lowe, you know Jonathan Love.
+44 775* ****85: Yes.
avraham adler: Jonathan Low also is.
avraham adler: And then I'm waiting for Sharon.
avraham adler: I need you to get me shot.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, I'm gonna get back on the LinkedIn and.
avraham adler: All right.
avraham adler: Thank you, Shane.
+44 775* ****85: All right.
+44 775* ****85: Cheers, my man.
+44 775* ****85: Thank you, sir.
+44 775* ****85: All the best, my friend.
Nikita Tyukalo: All right, take care, Shane.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, I'll be talking with Shane to get the E Commerce up and running really good asap.
avraham adler: And then I talked to Devin, who has like, a billion dollar revenue in terms of distribution and Tick tock running.
avraham adler: So he's gonna give me a line.
+44 775* ****85: See all those?
+44 775* ****85: I see.
+44 775* ****85: Like that.
+44 775* ****85: See, like that.
avraham adler: I thought you left.
avraham adler: God damn it.
+44 775* ****85: No, no, no.
+44 775* ****85: I'm blowing smoke up your ass, bro.
+44 775* ****85: I'm firing your fire up.
+44 775* ****85: See, because of it.
avraham adler: Because I told Andrew to come off.
avraham adler: I don't want you guys to at each other.
+44 775* ****85: Yeah, no, we will.
+44 775* ****85: Listen.
+44 775* ****85: I only get mad with people for two days.
+44 775* ****85: Tell him I love him now.
+44 775* ****85: He just needs to understand his position, and that's not in a company way.
avraham adler: I know, I know.
+44 775* ****85: His age is how he speaks to people.
+44 775* ****85: Me and you, right?
+44 775* ****85: Because we.
+44 775* ****85: We slag each other off, but we know that we're still on the same page.
+44 775* ****85: He's 22.
+44 775* ****85: You say no to him, and he's throwing this, and he don't want to talk.
+44 775* ****85: I'm like, seriously, you're gonna.
+44 775* ****85: You're gonna come into my boardroom or our boardroom, and you're going to be like that?
+44 775* ****85: Because I'm just going to be the first one to throw you straight through the window.
+44 775* ****85: Just understand that we're not all.
+44 775* ****85: We're not all made the same.
+44 775* ****85: Me and you rip the.
+44 775* ****85: Out of each other, but I know that Abby's a good guy.
+44 775* ****85: He's my.
+44 775* ****85: He's my friend.
+44 775* ****85: I've got him by my side.
+44 775* ****85: But we do this because we're having.
+44 775* ****85: We have like a.
+44 775* ****85: We like a.
+44 775* ****85: You know, me.
+44 775* ****85: It's just.
+44 775* ****85: He just needs that but under one.
+44 775* ****85: And I wish you all the best.
avraham adler: Thank you.
avraham adler: Appreciate your time.
avraham adler: All right.
avraham adler: Anything else you need for me before I get Andrew trying to join.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, he's, he's joining right now.
Nikita Tyukalo: Nothing else right now is needed.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh just to get Shane's number to my messages.
avraham adler: I'll get you, we'll put up, he's requesting join.
avraham adler: I'll put a group for all of us to talk.
avraham adler: Yeah, again, I don't want to like I'm kind of keeping church and state separate, just conducting it because until it's I, I again, you see I'm giving my trust and everything is there but like I want to make sure that it's buttoned up and we have money allocated and until then it's just theory in a dream.
avraham adler: It's just like me talking to Kazakhstan today and like I told you about that project and you know when we got off the phone the family office lady is like, well it's nice dream but do they have money to put in?
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
avraham adler: So I don't want to just start crossing wires and getting everybody.
avraham adler: Look, I see that in the brokering world as well, you know, when we're open and transparent and we trust each other but at the same time, if we're getting the same deal from five different directions, it just, it just makes a mess out of things.
avraham adler: You know, it has to become organized and rolled out in the proper ways and if we're all together in the same area and you know, working in the same place, then it's easy to do.
avraham adler: But if we're all over and you know, you said him and then I have to hear a second and it becomes drama and then potentially, you know, problems.
avraham adler: That's understandable.
avraham adler: Not, not gatekeeping honestly just trying to.
avraham adler: All right, so this is Andrew.
avraham adler: Andrew and I met under circumstances that the guy that he was running him essentially as his like front man for his scam and he thought he was running a trust that he was raising money for on also the same type of trading platform.
avraham adler: Long story short, realigned.
avraham adler: I, I felt, not, not that I felt bad, I don't mean it that way but I, you know what I mean?
avraham adler: I, I, I looked and I saw.
avraham adler: I identified somebody that is tenacious and a go getter and can make me seem more commercialized if you will because I'm very like I'm an when I'm doing my deal flow and dealing with people who don't follow, you know, procedures or just tell me that they're real or scams and whatnot.
avraham adler: So yeah, Andrew shared the same vision with Anavi and we wanted to implement it.
avraham adler: And then as I used my knowledge and experience in management.
avraham adler: And again, Andrew will talk about his experience and what it came to be and you know, the vision that we have on Avi.
avraham adler: So yeah, Andrew, this is Ariel and his team in development.
avraham adler: These are the guys that have the thousand models that I told you that we're going to streamline into the marketing and media.
avraham adler: They have phone farms and all that.
avraham adler: So why don't you just get introductory call and see what you want to talk about.
avraham adler: My man.
Andrew Godfrey: How's it going, my friend?
Andrew Godfrey: Where you calling from?
Nikita Tyukalo: Right now we're in Bellevue, Seattle.
avraham adler: Seattle, yeah.
avraham adler: Got you.
Andrew Godfrey: Is that, is that home base or is that just where you happen to be right now?
Nikita Tyukalo: This is where Nikita lives.
Nikita Tyukalo: So he's the owner of the orphan agency that's doing around 10 million a month.
Nikita Tyukalo: 9.
Nikita Tyukalo: 10 million a month with a thousand models?
Andrew Godfrey: Yeah.
Andrew Godfrey: So just to give you a little bit of a background on me a little bit.
Andrew Godfrey: Before I met Avi, I was in the marketing world.
Andrew Godfrey: I had two, two actually short and very blessed marketing exits.
Andrew Godfrey: One of those was a neuromarketing intelligence firm.
Andrew Godfrey: We provided a lot of data to companies.
Andrew Godfrey: Another one which is kind of a home improvement agency that got bought out by like a private equity company if you want to put it in that.
Andrew Godfrey: And then kind of just got into the world of making connections and everything kind of compounded.
Andrew Godfrey: Got into that little crypto ish, you know, trusting that Avi was just telling you about.
Andrew Godfrey: And then I had met Avi and then now we, now we are here, we're kind of aligning visions, kind of putting things together and.
Andrew Godfrey: Yeah, and now we're on a call with you.
Andrew Godfrey: So I'm glad that we're able to talk with you.
Andrew Godfrey: Another like minded individual.
Andrew Godfrey: It seems to kind of push our vision moving forward and I'd love to hear a little bit about you.
avraham adler: Yeah.
avraham adler: And Andrew, Ariel just heard me talking about the group when they had a demo that you didn't come on about the AI virtual assistant.
avraham adler: And he heard my idea or whatever vision of it and he just took off running and started building the CRM without direction or anything.
avraham adler: I didn't get a chance to really talk to Nikita much, but just waiting on the proposal from Veronica who does the PR and marketing, all that.
avraham adler: I just ran him through all the type of sectors and what sent them, you know, the basic, the white paper that we got from what's his name in Israel and show them the AI services sector and we're just chopping up, talking about what they have on there.
avraham adler: And what we have on there.
avraham adler: And like you said, just to get everybody aligned and designate, you know, value appropriate according to the assets and you know, equity stakes and everything that want to implement and once we have the liquidity but.
avraham adler: And Nikita himself and I haven't spoken to has the 10 million.
avraham adler: So we could potentially just start the ground running that way depending on how we have that conversation or like I told him, the 50 billion that I potentially have or any of our deals or all that jazz.
avraham adler: So yeah, that's where we're at conversation wise.
avraham adler: And this change has given the vision on the labs and what he wants to do in the medical sense.
avraham adler: And that's it.
Andrew Godfrey: Gotcha.
Andrew Godfrey: It's a pleasure to meet you, my friend.
Nikita Tyukalo: All right.
Andrew Godfrey: Is it lost you here?
Andrew Godfrey: Is it just us?
avraham adler: We lost it.
avraham adler: He's going to come back up.
avraham adler: Gotcha.
Andrew Godfrey: There.
avraham adler: We go.
Nikita Tyukalo: Hello?
avraham adler: Are you back?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes, gotcha.
Andrew Godfrey: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you my friend.
Andrew Godfrey: If you don't mind telling me a little bit about yourself just so I can understand who I'm speaking with.
avraham adler: Okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: Awesome.
Nikita Tyukalo: My name is Ariel.
Nikita Tyukalo: I with me and my partner Duro, we've been working together since first year of college.
Nikita Tyukalo: Different business ventures and learning and developing.
avraham adler: Where'd you go to college?
Nikita Tyukalo: So we're both from Canada, so we went to.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's an engineering focused college with a med school attached.
Nikita Tyukalo: University of Saskatchewan.
Nikita Tyukalo: They have like a particle accelerator like CERN under there.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's pretty strange just out in like the prairies of Canada.
Nikita Tyukalo: But yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: So since then we've kind of.
Nikita Tyukalo: We've launched agency together and we've worked together.
Nikita Tyukalo: We have a Relay Digital which is an e commerce focused.
Nikita Tyukalo: More of a holding company is of itself.
Nikita Tyukalo: We want to build the talent behind it and then be a holding company towards brands and obviously scale and then exit and then, then we have virtual exposure which is a service based service based with videographers and then the video editing and branding a package for realtors.
Nikita Tyukalo: So out in Canada, we're in Edmonton, we're a preferred partner with ReMax and a lot of unreal and a lot of the larger brokers out there.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then we can skill.
Nikita Tyukalo: Our plan was to scale in Canada, but then I kind of met up with Nikita.
Nikita Tyukalo: We got to talking, found out obviously how much he's doing per month.
Nikita Tyukalo: I think it's around 9 to $10 million in profit.
Nikita Tyukalo: And this is outside of like a lot of like the whales.
Nikita Tyukalo: The major whales.
avraham adler: Sure.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: So.
avraham adler: In network we have the guys who own only fans and it was for sale.
avraham adler: Somebody else transacted on it.
avraham adler: I'm trying to see if we could get in there potentially so once we get the customer base and we can roll out the coin to that as well.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, that'll be awesome.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, that'd be very, very interesting.
+44 775* ****85: And sure.
Andrew Godfrey: If you don't mind me asking, what's your reasoning behind why you guys got into what you're doing and the kind of the passion moving forward and I.
Nikita Tyukalo: Guess, okay, your vision moving forward, it's just kind of to build that the network, the holding company and the network of operators and then having the capital flow through where each operator can kind of run their team above just a lead and then transact and then that way things can be organized and then below and beneath all that, having a way for people to invest like the common folk to kind of view it as a hedge fund and then allocate capital and then benefit from a lot of what's happening.
Andrew Godfrey: Like a retail hedge fund type of thing.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes, exactly.
Nikita Tyukalo: But just obviously on chain and automated and with people that can really scale companies that know how to blitz scale within their, their pod and interact with the network.
Andrew Godfrey: And what was your passion behind, behind this?
Andrew Godfrey: What was the reason you kind of got into this in the first place for the money?
Andrew Godfrey: Is there something that you're like wanting to fix?
Nikita Tyukalo: What is, what is for me, for me.
Nikita Tyukalo: So coming like med school recently, my passion for health care and just comes from just wanting to develop obviously you know somebody, but then also like holistically like education wise, which is also a big part of my youth.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then obviously even though business and education kind of not exactly are opposite ends, but especially in the modern day, you'll find people kind of wanting to prioritize the other or making up their mind, but then obviously to become a holistic person.
Nikita Tyukalo: There's different aspects to both.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then just kind of everything that branches off that.
avraham adler: Yeah, absolutely.
Nikita Tyukalo: I'm on the kind of on the.
Andrew Godfrey: Same page as you, very kind of holistic in the health area when it comes to comes to that.
Andrew Godfrey: I like a lot of the stuff that the holistic avenues teach.
Andrew Godfrey: It's a lot more natural, it's a lot less of what you want to say corporate, more even more corruption side of things.
Andrew Godfrey: So I actually.
avraham adler: It's also not as intrusive and it's also preventative in most cases where science has a, you know, fixing stuff after the fact.
Andrew Godfrey: It's like a band aid usually versus what you guys have is actually holistic routes more or Less something that can cure and prevent things from even happening down the road.
Andrew Godfrey: So I absolutely synergize with that quite a bit.
Andrew Godfrey: I like to.
Andrew Godfrey: I like to.
Andrew Godfrey: Tommy, by the way, I like to ask those questions just because I like who we might be bringing on board and then also that we're going to be doing business with maybe in the future.
Andrew Godfrey: Who knows, maybe if we don't.
Andrew Godfrey: But at the same time, just being on the call and understanding your.
Andrew Godfrey: Your shoes and your visions and stuff's important, obviously, for our foundation and then everything moving forward because things can go.
Andrew Godfrey: Go through better, things get streamlined faster, and everybody's just kind of aligned.
Andrew Godfrey: Makes things a lot better, if you.
Nikita Tyukalo: Know what I'm talking about.
+44 775* ****85: Exactly.
Nikita Tyukalo: I'm grateful you asked that question also.
avraham adler: Cool.
avraham adler: Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Andrew Godfrey: And you said you're.
Andrew Godfrey: You're calling out of Seattle?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes, yes.
Andrew Godfrey: Is that where kind of the whole team is based and it's just you and.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then we have another core member of our dev team.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's very, very talented.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's 21.
Nikita Tyukalo: He probably.
avraham adler: He's.
Nikita Tyukalo: Eli would also rate him as probably one of the most talented for his age in Los Angeles.
Nikita Tyukalo: We had him out here.
Nikita Tyukalo: We met him recently, maybe two months ago.
Nikita Tyukalo: A friend of a friend is actually.
Nikita Tyukalo: A friend of mine is actually close, close friends with them.
Nikita Tyukalo: They did CPNs together back when they were young.
Nikita Tyukalo: So that was interesting to kind of have that connection.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then we had him out here working for maybe three weeks, and he's a bit remote now.
Nikita Tyukalo: So it's another core member.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, yeah.
Andrew Godfrey: And then in terms of kind of what from your understanding of what all that we have going on and everything that we're pushing in our vision, what are your.
Andrew Godfrey: What's your standpoint and thoughts on that?
Nikita Tyukalo: As far as my skill set that I can bring immediately.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just the development standpoint, helping make sure things are organized, clarifying the vision.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then not just clarifying it, but also making sure the vision is.
Nikita Tyukalo: Is put through systems that function autonomously in the way that we need them to so that we can have something physically built and then begin from that stage to develop upon it 100%.
Andrew Godfrey: And do you kind of see the vision that we're kind of aiming for and everything that we're trying to more or less accomplish?
Andrew Godfrey: I know that there's a lot, and it's kind of hard to comprehend for some, and I don't mean that in a bad way.
avraham adler: I don't think so at all.
Andrew Godfrey: But there's just this lot.
Andrew Godfrey: So do you kind of just understanding your shoes in terms of seeing our vision.
Andrew Godfrey: And then is that something that kind of you think that you align with as well in terms of pushing?
Andrew Godfrey: Because obviously I want you to be passionate about what you're going to be doing on your end of the stick.
Andrew Godfrey: Just because that helps the whole.
avraham adler: Very honestly, it's not an aerial, no disrespect, but it's really up to Nikita because that's who he works for.
avraham adler: But I'm sure he's reporting to Nikita and updating.
avraham adler: And the fact that he's engaged means that they're aligned.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes, exactly.
Nikita Tyukalo: And there's a lot of, like, there's a lot as far as what me and Duro have developed prior to me meeting Nikita to where Nikita also wants to kind of pivot his main focus from the modeling agency.
Nikita Tyukalo: He wants me and Duro to now run specifically, like, B2B, SAS and AI.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like, he's had that conversation with us even just today.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's the major pivot he wants to do.
Nikita Tyukalo: Sure.
avraham adler: Gotcha.
Andrew Godfrey: Well, dude, I'm glad.
Andrew Godfrey: I'm glad that we're able to speak.
Andrew Godfrey: It seems like there's a lot of different things that we can synergize on and align.
Nikita Tyukalo: There's actually something I wanted to speak to, something I actually had built a couple years ago when I was deep into the crypto space before I went to med school.
Nikita Tyukalo: Basically, it's a stablecoin that rewards simply like the same way a lot of these reflection rewards coins work, but then like owned by the.
Nikita Tyukalo: I guess the treasury would be the launch pad and then of course, you know, trading platform, and then of course also a treasury that held certain coins.
Nikita Tyukalo: So the purpose of the treasury would be to trade and then act like as a fund and then reward some cold.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's just simply, you know, baked into the tokenomics of what you're trying to do at scale with corporations, but then on chain.
avraham adler: Gotcha.
Andrew Godfrey: So it's kind of like a tokenization esque, ish project.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, tokenization esque fund crypto.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like, and then you'd have businesses that ran within crypto, like, you know, marketing agency, and then those profits would feed back into the holders, you know, fund.
Nikita Tyukalo: Sure.
Andrew Godfrey: I mean, dude, there's a lot of different opportunities just in the space right now to start, like, to be like the main pioneer in terms of tokenization within a specific space.
Andrew Godfrey: I mean, there's like a lot of, like, me and Avi were on a.
avraham adler: Call the other day with a connection.
Andrew Godfrey: Of ours, and he's going to start tokenizing like sports teams.
Andrew Godfrey: We've seen you know tokenizing historical assets to real estate tokens, you know, video games and stuff like that.
avraham adler: Cars, planes, everything.
Andrew Godfrey: So there's a lot of opportunity to get into.
avraham adler: It's really going to be the governments who are going to be implementing it.
avraham adler: So like, like we said that comes aligns with you know the project of Kazakhstan once we have one and we can implement it across country.
avraham adler: Side note, Jonathan is texting me.
avraham adler: You're going to be doing the MVP that you, you'll be able to share with us.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes.
avraham adler: Okay, so I'm just gonna do like what chat GPT shot my way and of course I look forward to that.
Nikita Tyukalo: Perfect, perfect.
avraham adler: Go on Andrew.
Andrew Godfrey: Yeah, no, I was just kind of getting at in terms of the tokenization.
Andrew Godfrey: I really like that space right now because there's a lot of different opportunities within that space to take advantage in.
avraham adler: Andrew, just interrupt.
avraham adler: That's what we were talking with some arrow around they have probably about a trillion dollars worth of assets including the art and the mines and global wise.
avraham adler: So yeah, that's why we want to connect.
avraham adler: I shot a text to Dwayne.
avraham adler: He's probably out for the weekend just to like say that I think Dwayne and I especially that I need support in terms of like directing it if you will.
avraham adler: You know, if he brings us their teams what they have on their plate and what we have on the plane now that we kissed them made up of James, we had that call and then Ricardo is going to focus on aviation and I'm going to put in together the Airbus people.
avraham adler: I have the guy yacht, yacht, whatever and yeah kind of collaborate and put the right team again internally just going to be structuring, you know, delegating and appropriating and then once we have the liquidity or Nikita is willing to already get in on the vision and ahead of time and give us that liquidity then we could start implementing with you know, legal and all that.
Nikita Tyukalo: So.
avraham adler: Just telling you what I'm thinking Ariel.
Nikita Tyukalo: Perfect, perfect.
avraham adler: Especially if he wants to put into the trading platform.
avraham adler: And again Mazda's evaluation is about 20 million.
avraham adler: So is John's.
avraham adler: John is more of a people person.
avraham adler: Like, like I told you, Maz is not difficult but he's very focused on his glofi because you know it's been his passion and he's been developing for two and a half years probably and doing on his own pocket.
avraham adler: So that's the only thing.
avraham adler: So.
avraham adler: But again like once we subscribe, once we come in with the money.
avraham adler: Obviously it's not.
avraham adler: It's not that I'm gonna power Stormy, but I'm like, listen, you want 20 million, exit whatever.
avraham adler: It's not about the money.
avraham adler: It's just like let's get it onboarded and together.
Nikita Tyukalo: Exactly.
avraham adler: Cool, my friend.
Nikita Tyukalo: Well, you said what you said Glo.
avraham adler: If you look at the MA and the buy thing, you'll see.
avraham adler: You'll see the deck and everything there and how it's working.
avraham adler: What's going to do and that's going to be focused more on the tokenization and real estate.
avraham adler: But again the value add not of course as a person and a team member and everything is founding is also the value added that he has the compliance know how and regulation global to transact globally.
avraham adler: Which is important crucial point.
avraham adler: You know, people are doing it on United States or sector by sector.
avraham adler: But he's done in a way where you could transfer assets across multiple verticals globally.
avraham adler: So from gold to gas, from whatever.
avraham adler: So that will fit right into the overall picture of the asset transactions into assets, you know, placement and allow the people to enter the real estate organization.
avraham adler: Plus the art and everything else that we'll be able to onboard with them just part of the same process.
Nikita Tyukalo: Nikita just walked in.
Nikita Tyukalo: You want to speak with him briefly?
Nikita Tyukalo: Sure.
avraham adler: I mean, go ahead.
avraham adler: All right.
+44 775* ****85: I got.
Nikita Tyukalo: I gotta.
Nikita Tyukalo: I gotta run upstairs.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's just like a quick intro.
Nikita Tyukalo: Always busy.
Nikita Tyukalo: Real quick.
avraham adler: All right.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just briefly.
Nikita Tyukalo: What we're.
avraham adler: We're talking about, bro.
Nikita Tyukalo: You can just outline.
avraham adler: You want me to go?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, just briefly.
avraham adler: So.
avraham adler: Thank you.
avraham adler: That we have a couple fintech products that are launched already and we have a couple, you know, things Ariel's team is putting, implementing and then we have alliances across all like I want to say all verticals, but crucial verticals in terms of Glo Fi being an asset placement and transactional to move one asset class to another globally.
avraham adler: And also have tokenization of things starting with real estate.
avraham adler: We also have alliances that have access to over a trillion in assets.
avraham adler: We also have ourselves between Jonathan Miles and I, about I don't know, 4 billion in ground assets, gold mines, proven reports and actual, you know, data centers as well.
avraham adler: I have alliances with solar and eco friendly and green projects.
avraham adler: We want to create the infrastructure where it's MVPs under a holding company.
avraham adler: You know, everyone comes in with their assets, with their value and get US appropriated their MVP's equity.
avraham adler: That makes sense for the valuation and then the equity stake in the holding company above it and then distributed back down with distribution flows.
avraham adler: That's just in the structure.
avraham adler: But again I don't think we're all again just getting to know you and this is like my second time talking to you briefly.
avraham adler: But with your team and the vision that they're implementing, I sense that that's your vision as well.
avraham adler: It's more of like a retail entry point and trying to chop away at that 1% of the world owning 50% of the assets and the liquids.
avraham adler: So we want to allow people to diversify portfolio and enter at a low cost and grow the portfolio.
avraham adler: We have the, the trading platform which is up and running.
avraham adler: We don't have the data, we just like went live two weeks ago.
avraham adler: It's doing about 20 a week.
avraham adler: I mean these are things that are usually given to private placement programs and you know, you have to come entry point of like 100 million or so of blocked funds or all type of procedures.
avraham adler: And you know, we're, we're creating an infrastructure of trusted, verified of compliant database and due diligence on the back end all legally and standard.
avraham adler: It's going to be the absolute, you know, gold go to standard to transact and we're going to have the assets as a backing to the stablecoin that will launch, you know, to have the transaction and grow on as well.
avraham adler: And we're going to have you know, a lab component, a healthcare component, actual physical gym locations with membership programs, kind of like a so house single like Blackstone or Bloomberg, but more retail focused, you know, across all spectrum.
avraham adler: That makes sense.
Nikita Tyukalo: I talked briefly about the SaaS aspect and the B2B, your B2B that you're running and the, your networks and your alliances in that range.
avraham adler: What do you mean specifically?
Nikita Tyukalo: Like what do you mean as far as B2B stats?
Nikita Tyukalo: For example, the team that you had before, what your internal teams are working on, what I've done previously, what I'm doing now, the call that we had with Sebastian, with Sebastian.
avraham adler: Sebastian, remind me, or is it Enoch?
avraham adler: His name is.
Nikita Tyukalo: Hold on.
avraham adler: Oh, those guys, the virtual guys.
avraham adler: Yeah, they, they're doing the voice.
avraham adler: I don't even know that's their project.
avraham adler: I just wanted to onboard them.
avraham adler: But we have that aspect in the trading platform as well.
avraham adler: An AI agent that learns, you know what you want to do, but you want to do the visual AI and also probably implement it to websites we feel is outdated.
avraham adler: So interactive websites and also the virtual component where you can speak to you know, let's say a kiosk at McDonald's and say hey, I want a cheeseburger with two tomatoes and a large Coke on the side.
avraham adler: We'll switch that menu and interact with CEO Coin.
avraham adler: You can have that across all spectrums from banking for.
avraham adler: Again, we're not going to be first to market, but there's plenty market there to be had.
avraham adler: And if we, you know, pivot and implement all that, it's a blue ocean strategy.
Andrew Godfrey: You know, it's not new to the market, but it brings something new to the market.
avraham adler: But.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then this is a kind of bit of left field.
Nikita Tyukalo: But would you happen to know anyone or have a connection to someone who works at CB within the dev team or who else?
Nikita Tyukalo: Higher ups.
Nikita Tyukalo: Cb, the medical thing, the streaming site.
avraham adler: Oh, we have, I mean I have access to Disney, Universal, Netflix for the models.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's interesting.
Nikita Tyukalo: We can, we can add that to the deck for later.
avraham adler: Not familiar with cb.
avraham adler: Who's to be.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, that's fine, that's fine.
avraham adler: But we can add again, we, we have the all.
avraham adler: We have the only fans and the owners that have them reach out.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, you have the only fans, owners, CBs, chatterbait.
avraham adler: I don't know them.
avraham adler: Oh, that's the, the weird, the porno thing, right?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, yeah.
avraham adler: No, I don't know.
avraham adler: I don't, it's not my, I don't really do that porno thing.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, yeah, that's fine.
Nikita Tyukalo: But we can even, even the guy.
avraham adler: Who owned pornhub pivoted.
avraham adler: He sold it and he does.
avraham adler: Consolidation.
avraham adler: I didn't even talk about that.
avraham adler: I have a, I have a bunch of alliances with MCA that have open books of debt, a couple billions.
avraham adler: And you know, we want to consolidate.
avraham adler: I spoke to you about briefly before.
avraham adler: We want to consolidate the assets, waive the debt for equity position and distribution of the assets and then create a back office to consolidate in multiple way.
avraham adler: 3.
Nikita Tyukalo: After we spoke about that, we also spoke about the credit with the models.
Nikita Tyukalo: Nikita's here so you could speak a bit about that.
avraham adler: Right.
avraham adler: So every person has, you know, value in terms of their credit that they could bring in.
avraham adler: You have to, I have to check with legal and compliance and all that, but I'm pretty sure we could do it legally to allow every model to leverage her credit.
avraham adler: Let's say she has 50,000.
avraham adler: We onboard it to a credit worthy individual.
avraham adler: We add credit lines to her name, he or her whatever it is, and then we add, you know, let's say from 50,000 easily to 300.
avraham adler: 350,000.
avraham adler: We allow them to liquefy their credit by transacting on their credit Cards into.
Nikita Tyukalo: Into.
avraham adler: What do you call it?
avraham adler: Into inventory that we then sell.
avraham adler: Usually a 30 day turnaround if it's a good point thing, they take that liquid and then we give them an entry point into the deal flow that's vetted and they will be able to make profit and reinvest.
avraham adler: You know we could.
Nikita Tyukalo: So what does he specifically want from that?
Nikita Tyukalo: This is like the kind of thing.
Nikita Tyukalo: So bro, talk a bit more about the New York models.
Nikita Tyukalo: We have some in New York.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then also what you want to do with.
Nikita Tyukalo: Well just explain.
Nikita Tyukalo: I can kind of explain how I.
+44 775* ****85: Can help explain what Ariel, what you.
Nikita Tyukalo: Want to do with the models, credit profiles and then ask about the New York models as well.
avraham adler: So those two topics I should ask about the nos.
avraham adler: Yeah, what am I asking the New York models?
Nikita Tyukalo: Like what was your plan?
Nikita Tyukalo: Because we do have some.
avraham adler: Oh so we again we could do the marketing, the pr, the social management, the clipping.
avraham adler: You know, now that Ariel has the form farms as well and house we have also army intelligence platforms that could geolocate, you know an appropriate where we do it.
avraham adler: So it's an in house influence structure where we could have product lines that they want to launch.
avraham adler: Obviously we'll identify who is the best to launch what product at what location and kind of build the media.
avraham adler: I think we also have a media component to our arm that we have alliance with that is getting 150 million allocation with our assets as collateral to launch movies and TV shows.
avraham adler: So it's all in house, it's all going to be one hand.
avraham adler: Sorry.
Nikita Tyukalo: So you guys want to take that on yourself just for the rev.
avraham adler: We want to do together.
avraham adler: We want to align everyone together and like I said, everybody comes with their.
Nikita Tyukalo: So what do you need from the model Models?
Nikita Tyukalo: You just need model connections.
avraham adler: You give us access to the models, we'll.
avraham adler: We'll again make sure that everything legally is client and available to do the way I said it is.
avraham adler: And then we have leverage with the liquidity to then internally reposition and then launch products based on the geolocation or whatever affiliation or what.
avraham adler: Or also we have to, you know.
Nikita Tyukalo: I mean I basically have unlimited.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So I don't know like Ariel, Ariel's new to me but you know I have basically any connection within the modeling industry or anything like that.
Nikita Tyukalo: Correct.
avraham adler: That's what I did.
avraham adler: So just the background, like a little bit of what I did back in the day before I got a little smarter and hopefully getting smarter every day.
avraham adler: I had the same type of structure where I had the girls in house.
avraham adler: I provided them houses to live in.
avraham adler: I'd have them pay half the rent, take care of the place.
avraham adler: They would be my friends.
avraham adler: I would also have them reach out to their network and obviously all the guys hitting on them who usually.
avraham adler: Guys who need to afford that are usually people who are.
avraham adler: And influential in different industries.
avraham adler: So they would kind of bring them in and I would have them aligned with my investment portfolio that I had a time over.
avraham adler: 35 companies, different spectrums.
Nikita Tyukalo: And do you work with any funds or anything?
avraham adler: I did not.
avraham adler: We do not want private equity funds.
avraham adler: We will create our own arm because we want to have a different vision.
avraham adler: But, you know, that's what I'm.
Nikita Tyukalo: I'm just asking.
avraham adler: I just.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's what I'm in right now.
Nikita Tyukalo: So if you know anybody that's Interested.
Nikita Tyukalo: Low risk.
Nikita Tyukalo: 500%.
Nikita Tyukalo: Last year, 1700.
Nikita Tyukalo: High risk.
Nikita Tyukalo: Thank you.
avraham adler: You have a private equity, you're saying?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, okay.
avraham adler: I mean, whatever you want.
avraham adler: And we have access to family offices.
avraham adler: Private equity.
avraham adler: I just told earlier, like, we're spearheading a campaign with Kazakhstan.
avraham adler: It's not locked in, but to redevelop a country with the US mentality, with the brands.
avraham adler: And we're going to be, you know, spearheading that with family athletes who has heavily invested in defense contracts.
avraham adler: And they're coming with money, you know, they're coming 7.3 B.
avraham adler: My family office has like 5, 10 allocated.
avraham adler: I myself should be getting 50 B by the end of the month.
avraham adler: So again, we're just going to hit the ground running.
avraham adler: We want to be like a global, you know, global thing before the people, you know, entry point.
avraham adler: Not just like a black.
Nikita Tyukalo: What do you guys.
Nikita Tyukalo: What do you guys want from these models?
Nikita Tyukalo: Just whatever you guys need them to do.
Nikita Tyukalo: Bang out, content wise.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, like product directly, all that.
avraham adler: We could do the distribution.
avraham adler: We could do the branding.
avraham adler: We could do the AI.
avraham adler: We could do, you know, everything.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
+44 775* ****85: Can you.
Nikita Tyukalo: Do you want them to be in New York or you just want models that convert best.
avraham adler: Yeah, I don't care where they are.
Nikita Tyukalo: But, bro, let's just give them summer.
Nikita Tyukalo: Ava.
Nikita Tyukalo: Summer would be great.
Nikita Tyukalo: Ava would be great.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, Make a group chat with me and him.
avraham adler: He's.
Nikita Tyukalo: Do you already know him on signal or.
avraham adler: No.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: Make a group chat with him on signal.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yes.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then Veronica will get the info.
Nikita Tyukalo: Packet because Ariel talks about a lot of.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's about to make a group chat.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just let me know how you kind of want to see things go and then I can set it up easily.
avraham adler: I Want to know what you want brother?
avraham adler: I want to know what your vision, what your goal was, your five year roll up plan.
avraham adler: If you're subscribing to this vision that I'm pulling to you now, right now again we have the trading platform.
avraham adler: Until now.
avraham adler: I mean I wouldn't say till now.
avraham adler: Maybe there's other people working on it but I don't know of any.
avraham adler: You know the private placement is you know, entry barrier point of 100 million and you know they're getting returns of 8010 and giving 5% commissions and whatnot.
avraham adler: It's just not available to the main land.
avraham adler: Now we're making on a retail.
avraham adler: It's.
avraham adler: It's going to be a money printing machine and then the assets are going to be back backing the stable coin.
avraham adler: You know, it's, it's.
avraham adler: We're going to be positioned to take over the world.
avraham adler: Literally.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: So.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh you're, you're competing with Hunter.
Nikita Tyukalo: You can easily compete with Bags.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's not well, Hunter owns Bags.
Nikita Tyukalo: Well, I know Hunter, but yeah, so you know I do a couple mil a month, you know, just off this.
Nikita Tyukalo: I mean you could technically classify it as of but I don't really run of.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's not where I make most of my money from.
Nikita Tyukalo: And yeah, you know, just a bunch of girls that are in house and stuff like that getting into private equity and we trade all that.
avraham adler: Yeah, I got that same, same idea.
avraham adler: But I just wanted to know if you want to align or do you just want to.
Nikita Tyukalo: I mean everything, you know, everything you're saying is no, sounds good but you know I, I've never talked to you before.
Nikita Tyukalo: I mean so, so what does he do?
Nikita Tyukalo: So this is the guy who said who's gonna do the other foot back and forth but they, he told him.
Nikita Tyukalo: And you guys have the liquidity to do all this.
avraham adler: So like I said, not gonna lie to you right now we're asset rich, cash poor.
avraham adler: But like I said, I have a BTC backer and buyer of mine for over two years.
avraham adler: That relationship with the controller, he's allocating 50B that 50B that he hasn't been able to transact with to purchase the BTC he wants.
avraham adler: He's giving it to my friend who controls those wallets with his tech team and he's basically giving it to me to put into trade.
avraham adler: The contract is signed on the liquidity provider's side.
avraham adler: We have yet to execute.
avraham adler: It should be done by the end of the month, God willing.
avraham adler: We also have many deals that we are God Willing going to close but again it's not, you know, it's all vision.
avraham adler: So I don't want to tell you that's there but that's what we have going.
avraham adler: We also have a guy I'm meeting on Tuesday in Miami that wants to onboard $1 billion.
avraham adler: I also spoke to Floyd Mayweather son that he was going to hire me like two years ago.
avraham adler: I asked him what's he up to.
avraham adler: He said he has eight digits, he's doing about 10%.
avraham adler: He does AI like basics so he doesn't really know the system.
avraham adler: He's more just a name brand name Floyd.
avraham adler: So all those in my family office can allocate.
avraham adler: She wants to allocate 135 million for trade and she wants me to open up a Barclays UK account.
avraham adler: With my banking relationships I could easily do that and she's going to give me 1% and she's putting in 5 billion.
avraham adler: So that's also liquidity.
avraham adler: So again all these things are happening fast and you know the trading platform just went live, the GLOFI is ready to go live.
avraham adler: Assets are there.
avraham adler: Once we have the liquidity we're going to start digging it out.
avraham adler: We just got approach of a couple more billion dollars in ground assets in America globally and then we have close relationships with another team that has close to a trillion honestly in grand assets globally and we also tokenizing art.
avraham adler: I submitted a portfolio of 260 million.
avraham adler: I have a BTC owner that have alloys and lawyers talking to more actually with the guitar fund who has 500 billion allocated for BTC purchase.
avraham adler: I also have a million BTC holder from the Limitless group that they're starting to sell next week.
avraham adler: I'm heavily involved with them for over two years and there's a team there but I'm part of that team.
avraham adler: There's also another seller that's meeting on the 22nd to transact in 20,000 BTCs that already everything is spoken for, understood and agreed.
avraham adler: So these are all things that are going to happen.
avraham adler: I'm not here to say hey if I have more money than you, I'm better than you.
avraham adler: I'm not here to dictate.
avraham adler: I'm not trying to do it.
avraham adler: We're trying to do it like all together as a team that shares the same vision.
avraham adler: You know, all for one, one for all.
avraham adler: Obviously you just got to know me.
avraham adler: Like you said, same goes vice versa.
avraham adler: Usually you could tell what a person's about and how they're implementing and actually speak louder in the world.
avraham adler: I'm Just giving you the vision, trying to align with the right alliances and you know, within the infrastructure, everybody's going to be able to win and eat.
avraham adler: And it's not about the money on us.
avraham adler: It's about changing the world.
avraham adler: For me at least.
Nikita Tyukalo: Interesting.
Nikita Tyukalo: Let's talk, bro.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, brother.
avraham adler: Yeah, Aerial.
+44 775* ****85: Connect us.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, Signal.
Nikita Tyukalo: Do you have the Signal app?
avraham adler: Yes, I do.
avraham adler: You already connected me with somebody.
avraham adler: I'm not sure if it's him or not.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yep.
Nikita Tyukalo: Perfect, perfect, perfect.
avraham adler: All right.
avraham adler: I didn't tell him about who I'm flying to meet now until I forgot.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, yeah, you're there for.
Nikita Tyukalo: Where you headed?
avraham adler: I'm headed to meeting Joby Weeks.
avraham adler: You can google him, share your article.
avraham adler: Actually, he's on Signal also.
avraham adler: He's in the house arrest for six years.
avraham adler: He put a YouTube thing because obviously you need PR before you get the pardon.
Nikita Tyukalo: 722 million dollar Ponzi scheme.
avraham adler: Well, you're his side of the things.
Nikita Tyukalo: I got house arrest.
avraham adler: They leveraged him because he just had a newborn daughter.
avraham adler: I put it on the chat with guys.
avraham adler: That's who I'm meeting tomorrow's lawyer.
avraham adler: And I already had the preliminary talks of Cash Patel's team through somebody else.
avraham adler: I said everything should be good to go.
avraham adler: Watch the video when you have time.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
avraham adler: Again, he's the same type of guy.
avraham adler: Like do you think modest.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, by the way, quick question.
Nikita Tyukalo: Does Veronica have a signal as well?
avraham adler: I don't know, doctor on WhatsApp.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, perfect.
avraham adler: And again, everybody, like I said, it's a mix of young, tenacious grip people and at the top, you know, at the top, but experience people 20 years usually in their vertical.
avraham adler: You know, experience and know how and navigation skills and connections and finances.
Nikita Tyukalo: Or.
Nikita Tyukalo: They hear me.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, brother, I'll.
Nikita Tyukalo: Let's see if I can send you actually a little bit at least so you can kind of see.
avraham adler: I'm sorry.
Nikita Tyukalo: If I can send you a little bit of CRM so you can guys, see how it looks.
avraham adler: Okay, perfect.
avraham adler: Appreciate that, Andrew.
avraham adler: I'll give that to you as well so we can check in on their work.
Nikita Tyukalo: Cheers.
+44 775* ****85: Have a good one, guys.
avraham adler: All right, bye.

Speakers: Duro Pirisola, Dug Dugmor
Sentences: Duro Pirisola: Honestly, not sure.
Dug Dugmor: Okay, so what we could do is I can have my tech support help you set up the controller.
Dug Dugmor: How.
Dug Dugmor: How many phones do you currently have?
Duro Pirisola: We're testing with 10 right now.
Duro Pirisola: Okay.
Duro Pirisola: We're able to connect eight, like prior to this.
Duro Pirisola: But basically what we're trying to do is have a bunch of phone scripts and then use like a Microsoft link thing to send it or point on.
Dug Dugmor: Hold on.
Dug Dugmor: It's kind of getting your.
Duro Pirisola: Your.
Dug Dugmor: Your sound is.
Dug Dugmor: Wasn't.
Dug Dugmor: I couldn't hear exactly.
Duro Pirisola: Join me.
Duro Pirisola: Yeah, we're trying to connect a bunch of phones to our genius world.
Duro Pirisola: Okay.
Duro Pirisola: And then through that, like use like a Microsoft link to send it over to our VA so they can control like accounts.
Dug Dugmor: Okay.
Dug Dugmor: So how.
Dug Dugmor: The best way, I think if your VA is remote, they could log into your desktop or your computer using either Rust Desk or any desk.
Duro Pirisola: Yeah, you recommend that?
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, that's pretty much the easiest way that if we want.
Dug Dugmor: If your VA is remotely logging into your box.
Duro Pirisola: And what about like account restrictions and stuff?
Duro Pirisola: Because want to use like Snapchat and those kinds of apps, is that going to cause any issues?
Dug Dugmor: No, it won't.
Dug Dugmor: Once.
Dug Dugmor: Once you set up the remote desktop, like any desk, I think is a.
Dug Dugmor: Is the paid version.
Dug Dugmor: Rust Desk is free.
Dug Dugmor: I'm not sure how it works with multiple.
Dug Dugmor: But what they could do is they can log into your desktop remotely using any desk, and from there they'll be able to control all your phones from the controller.
Duro Pirisola: And that would be through.
Duro Pirisola: Jesus.
Duro Pirisola: So we don't need like a bunch of emulators to run any desk, right?
Dug Dugmor: Correct.
Dug Dugmor: You don't need any emulators.
Dug Dugmor: All you have to do is connect your desktop through any desk and then said what?
Duro Pirisola: Yeah, what about multiple VA as well?
Dug Dugmor: Your VAs will log in through any desk.
Duro Pirisola: Yeah.
Duro Pirisola: What about most VAs?
Duro Pirisola: Like every single VA is gonna use the same.
Duro Pirisola: Any desk.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, well, each.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, they.
Dug Dugmor: I don't think you can log in multiple because you'll be logging in one VA and that.
Dug Dugmor: I mean, maybe you could.
Dug Dugmor: Maybe you can log in.
Dug Dugmor: I'm not sure.
Dug Dugmor: On a paid account you might be able to log in with multiple accounts, but most of the time it works best if you just have a VA log in through anydesk and then from there you could just.
Dug Dugmor: The VA can control all your phones.
Duro Pirisola: But one VA for 20 phones is a lot of like, a lot.
Dug Dugmor: Not really.
Dug Dugmor: I mean, well, we.
Dug Dugmor: We run more than 20 phones.
Duro Pirisola: Like, but not really doing automations, just doing kind of like to make it to stay High on trust score.
Duro Pirisola: Just feeding, you can feed the pressure and touchscreen right to the phones.
Dug Dugmor: I'm sorry, what was that you cut out?
Duro Pirisola: You can use a mouse click to feed pressure and touch to the phones, right?
Dug Dugmor: Correct.
Dug Dugmor: With the controller, you'll be able to operate all your phones just from the controller.
Dug Dugmor: So have you connected your phones already via the USB cable?
Duro Pirisola: Yes.
Duro Pirisola: Okay.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah.
Dug Dugmor: So once you connect the phones, you'll be able to set up.
Dug Dugmor: We could help you set up the controller.
Dug Dugmor: We'll help you set up the controller, connect the phones, and then from there your VA can start connecting all of your mobile apps.
Dug Dugmor: Like you said, Snapchat, you know, Instagram, everything you need from there.
Duro Pirisola: Okay.
Duro Pirisola: And then as well.
Duro Pirisola: So we need a way, we need some type of system where we can split it up between the va.
Duro Pirisola: So how can we.
Duro Pirisola: Can we take.
Duro Pirisola: Can we take everything that's being fed through juice box and then split it up in our own web web hosted login?
Dug Dugmor: So you mean.
Dug Dugmor: Oh, okay, so you're saying that you want, like to use a vps, like a VPS server to lock to.
Dug Dugmor: Well, you're, you're.
Dug Dugmor: The only thing is your phones have to be fit.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah.
Dug Dugmor: They have to be physically connected to your computer.
Duro Pirisola: No, but I'm saying like, if we can run something else that takes.
Duro Pirisola: Can we like, can we API the controllers away to another.
Duro Pirisola: Another interface?
Dug Dugmor: You could, yeah.
Dug Dugmor: I mean, yeah, we could set you up so you have multiple.
Dug Dugmor: So you're saying you want to have multiple computers or you want to have.
Duro Pirisola: Like, if we can, we can, we can get it down to 5 per computer, that's fine.
Duro Pirisola: But like, is there a way to split it down even narrower, even less than five per computer?
Dug Dugmor: You might mean like one computer or.
Duro Pirisola: Like, because if we can split, Send each.
Duro Pirisola: The control is what we want to API.
Duro Pirisola: So we can API the controller to one specific VA where they can log in on their laptop, send in the touchscreen, whatever, while seeing the live feed, and then it'll send back to our controller here, which feeds into the Jesus box.
Dug Dugmor: Let me see.
Dug Dugmor: So you're saying that you want to have each VA operate five phones.
Dug Dugmor: Is that maybe hold on your microphone, your microphone.
Duro Pirisola: Is.
Duro Pirisola: Is it possible to have each VA operate each phone and log in from, from a web?
Duro Pirisola: Or is that something we can build an API?
Duro Pirisola: Like.
Dug Dugmor: It'S possibly.
Dug Dugmor: We could set it up that way.
Dug Dugmor: The only thing is, yeah, each computer will have to control the phone box or phones, whatever, how many phones you want to control from there.
Dug Dugmor: Could we set up A different instance of Windows, possibly.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, let me, Let me get with my tech support and we'll make sure we help you set it up on what you need to do.
Dug Dugmor: So, and you know, how many phones you want, how many VAs.
Duro Pirisola: Is it like this?
Duro Pirisola: Like, realistically, can we do like, I, I know one license page for like the whole software, but because of the way we're trying to do it, we don't even want multiple phones connected.
Duro Pirisola: So is there a way to talk to you about like getting the licenses at a different rate since we're using the software differently?
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, yeah, we'll help you.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, I have no problem.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, that's not a problem.
Dug Dugmor: I appreciate you.
Duro Pirisola: It's not.
Dug Dugmor: I'm not going to charge you more for that, like setting up with different.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah.
Dug Dugmor: Okay, so why don't you do this?
Dug Dugmor: Send me an email of how many VAs you have, how many phones you have.
Dug Dugmor: Well, how many computers you have.
Dug Dugmor: If you have one, just know and then let me know.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, then I'll try to.
Dug Dugmor: I'll talk to my va. My.
Dug Dugmor: I'm sorry, my tech to figure out what is the best solution for you.
Dug Dugmor: And yeah, I mean, if you need extra control licenses, that's no problem.
Dug Dugmor: I'm not going to charge you.
Duro Pirisola: Thank you so much.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, I appreciate it and I understand that what you're trying to do.
Dug Dugmor: Okay, so why don't you do that Just so I understand.
Dug Dugmor: I'll talk to my techs and then we can help you set up everything and get you going.
Dug Dugmor: So if you don't mind me asking, which platforms are you using?
Dug Dugmor: Because I know that you also are using our Instagram automator.
Duro Pirisola: Yes.
Duro Pirisola: We'll also want to call and then have maybe if you need to pay, that's fine.
Duro Pirisola: Consulting to have a VA go through and teach ours how to set it up and use it and then get set up automated at some time.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, no problem.
Dug Dugmor: No problem.
Dug Dugmor: So did you send the VAs, the.
Dug Dugmor: The knowledge base?
Dug Dugmor: Let me send you the knowledge base.
Duro Pirisola: Okay.
Dug Dugmor: So your VAS can start at least learning it and then they'll be familiar with the software before we.
Dug Dugmor: We get on with them and teach them if they need.
Dug Dugmor: So maybe with the Telegram group that we started with, the group chat with my support team, have your VAs, I think maybe join that and we'll send you the knowledge base so they can get started on it at least.
Dug Dugmor: And once they're familiar with the tool, the software, then we.
Dug Dugmor: If they need more help, of course we'll help you.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, that's not a problem.
Duro Pirisola: Perfect.
Duro Pirisola: Thank you.
Duro Pirisola: Thank you.
Duro Pirisola: And then, yeah, we'll just get back.
Duro Pirisola: So for now, maybe you can tell the VA we have our one main laptop here, and.
Duro Pirisola: But each of our VAs will have a laptop, and then we have 10 VAs.
Duro Pirisola: So if we want, potentially, if we would need up to 10 license keys, if that'd be possible.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, that's no problem.
Dug Dugmor: Okay.
Dug Dugmor: 10 VAs, one main computer where you're located.
Duro Pirisola: One.
Dug Dugmor: And then you have how many phones?
Duro Pirisola: We have 15 phones for right now, but we'd like to get maybe 10 license keys, if possible.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, no problem.
Dug Dugmor: Okay, so one VA, one main computer where the phones are located.
Dug Dugmor: 15 phones and.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah.
Dug Dugmor: All right, let me find out exactly what the.
Dug Dugmor: The setup will be for this, and we'll get going.
Dug Dugmor: So, I mean, maybe if you want to have your.
Dug Dugmor: If you have a team leader VA or whoever joined the group, chat that on Telegram with my support, and then from there we'll.
Dug Dugmor: We'll get you set up.
Duro Pirisola: Okay, cool.
Dug Dugmor: Okay, I understand.
Dug Dugmor: We'll give you extra licenses to make sure that it works for you.
Duro Pirisola: Thank you.
Duro Pirisola: All right.
Duro Pirisola: Thank you.
Dug Dugmor: Do you have any other questions?
Dug Dugmor: Do you have any other questions?
Duro Pirisola: No other questions.
Duro Pirisola: I guess it will be two of my head vas, because we're having.
Duro Pirisola: Trying to run different farms and then anything realistically, we'd want to get on board with a lot of.
Duro Pirisola: For other services that you offer.
Duro Pirisola: Once we get this done, we'd move on to all of them.
Duro Pirisola: So thank you so much.
Dug Dugmor: Thank you.
Dug Dugmor: Thank you so much.
Dug Dugmor: If you don't mind me asking, how did you find me?
Duro Pirisola: First of all, we're in the same only reals group chat with phone from Guy.
Duro Pirisola: I'm just learning.
Duro Pirisola: So seeing.
Duro Pirisola: Do you guys run AI generation on your side or any model?
Dug Dugmor: You mean to create AI?
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, yeah, we're doing a little bit.
Dug Dugmor: We're helping out some clients with that.
Dug Dugmor: We'll let you know what we're coming up with because obviously it's moving so fast.
Duro Pirisola: Yeah, we built a platform.
Duro Pirisola: So me and together with my partner here, you developed a platform.
Duro Pirisola: So if you would want to, like, even get started with using that and selling that, we could set that up right away for you.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, yeah, Send me everything you guys got.
Dug Dugmor: I'm always willing to work with different people.
Dug Dugmor: And I mean, it's awesome, you know, to work together since we're already doing something.
Dug Dugmor: Yeah, send me everything, and I'll send you everything over for your vas to start with the.
Dug Dugmor: The tool, the software.
Duro Pirisola: Okay, perfect.
Duro Pirisola: Thank you so much.

Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, okay, explain.
Nikita Tyukalo: So just explain the pricing.
dan: Yeah.
dan: So this obviously is not like the standard thing that we do.
dan: We usually like, lease out account, not.
Nikita Tyukalo: To cut you off.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, so the snap thing, also, we know that it works like, obviously on the.
Nikita Tyukalo: That platform, whatever we're talking about detect features.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So if we set it up anywhere, the software won't get detected over time.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right, Based off snap privacy.

dan: And I'll tell you what we have right now and then tell me if you need it differently.
dan: Right now, we have it in our warehouse ready to go.
dan: And then anyone can download any desk or do a remote hookup to these platforms, and we'll specify it and hook up some more computers, depending on how you guys need to use it.
Nikita Tyukalo: So everyone can log in any desk?
dan: Exactly.
dan: So your VAs can hop on and log in remotely to our location, and then they can run all the iPhones from there.
dan: And I sent a video of someone doing that.
Nikita Tyukalo: So with it, with your software, you're doing one computer controls several phones at the same time.
dan: It just depends how you guys.
dan: Like my devil asks you guys questions.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's.
dan: He texted me this right now, like literally a minute ago.
dan: What'd you say?
Nikita Tyukalo: Can you put us in a meeting with your dev?
Nikita Tyukalo: No, but then if you're gonna have to translate for us, like, stuff's gonna get lost in translation.

Carmello Gainz: Much more, it's much easier in terms.
Carmello Gainz: Of, in terms of account creation rather than rotating.
Carmello Gainz: Because with rotating you don't have like a specific location to it unless you, you get this one.
Carmello Gainz: Unless you get this one which, where you can pinpoint like a specific location.
Carmello Gainz: But essentially for account creation we need the accounts to be in Seattle or anywhere near the Washington.
Carmello Gainz: Washington state.
Carmello Gainz: So once you add in the proxy, you are gonna change the Android version.
Carmello Gainz: So this, this is pretty much like what makes or breaks the account relation because sometimes like a specific Android model does not work with account creation and Instagram just automatically bans the accounts.
Carmello Gainz: So right now we're basing it off our Tinder account creation.
Carmello Gainz: So for today, the best version is.
Carmello Gainz: Android 14 and then the device is.
Carmello Gainz: Always Samsung and The version is S20.
Carmello Gainz: 4.
Carmello Gainz: S24.
Carmello Gainz: And then just create.
Carmello Gainz: That.
Carmello Gainz: So once that's done, you just go.
Carmello Gainz: To applications, make sure to always have.
Carmello Gainz: Instagram installed and also TikTok mobile in case, for future, in case you create TikTok as well.
Carmello Gainz: And then you just start program.
Carmello Gainz: Wait.
Carmello Gainz: For it to pop up.
Carmello Gainz: This might take a while, but essentially if you have, you can potentially create.
Carmello Gainz: Like three at a time.
Carmello Gainz: Three accounts at a time.
Carmello Gainz: So that would like boost the numbers.
Carmello Gainz: In terms of account creation daily.
Carmello Gainz: But yeah, you can create three accounts.
Carmello Gainz: At a time with different, with each cloud phones and I think based on the sop.
Carmello Gainz: Based on the sop, you wouldn't have.
Carmello Gainz: To do anything like on the first day, you just need to create the.
Ariel Erhaze: Account.
Carmello Gainz: And yeah, just Follow this.
Carmello Gainz: Add profile photo, add short bio, follow.
Carmello Gainz: Page of accounts, scroll the feed for 33 minutes and then close the app.
Carmello Gainz: So for this you're gonna need this sms.
Carmello Gainz: It.
Carmello Gainz: This is a sample amount.
Carmello Gainz: But since you can set it all up based on, based on your sheets.
Carmello Gainz: In terms of tracking, you can get that covered.
Carmello Gainz: But pretty much just need to have them age as 2000 area.
Carmello Gainz: What age should we add?
Carmello Gainz: Should we make the models 18?
Ariel Erhaze: We should probably do them the real birthday for one day.
Carmello Gainz: Need to verify them 2006 or 7.
Ariel Erhaze: So you can ask Kamal for the real birthday since you're making accounts and you're making mass accounts for your birthday.
Carmello Gainz: Yeah, essentially.
Carmello Gainz: But just make them 18.
Ariel Erhaze: Oh yeah, yeah.
Ariel Erhaze: Over, over 18.
Ariel Erhaze: So essentially for now it's kind of fine because in the future you can add them to account center.
Ariel Erhaze: In the account center.
Ariel Erhaze: Right.
Ariel Erhaze: So we can add like a couple together in an account center and then when we merge them, we can merge it to the correct birthday.
Ariel Erhaze: So it's fine for them just.
Ariel Erhaze: And just note the birthday though.
Ariel Erhaze: But it's not, it's not really even necessary to know the birthday.
Ariel Erhaze: But you can.
Carmello Gainz: Okay.
Carmello Gainz: But yeah, essentially make them 18.
Carmello Gainz: That's why it's essential to have like.
Carmello Gainz: Multiple, multiple profiles because of the long wait time, the long, you know, when.
Carmello Gainz: It loads back longer than expected.
Ariel Erhaze: So is it okay to open multiple profiles at the same time and let them all load?
Carmello Gainz: Yeah, as long as you're using them.
Carmello Gainz: Like.
Ariel Erhaze: You need more parallels basically for sure.
Carmello Gainz: Right?
Carmello Gainz: Yeah, yeah, it.
Carmello Gainz: Okay, so this is like the verification stage.
Carmello Gainz: So when it goes to this, then I'll be, you know, do not be alarmed.
Carmello Gainz: This is normal.
Carmello Gainz: But when it asks for a video, that's when you know, it's like the comp is dead.
Carmello Gainz: That can't be.
Carmello Gainz: Like there's no workaround.
Carmello Gainz: That there's no workaround to it.
Ariel Erhaze: If it asks for video, what if we log in from these phones and then give the video?
Ariel Erhaze: Will it work?
Ariel Erhaze: So say, what if it asks for video?
Ariel Erhaze: What if we log in from these phones here and.
Carmello Gainz: Well, you can, well, you can verify it, but it just, you know, it just.
Carmello Gainz: So it's time you can just create another account.
Carmello Gainz: It happens sometimes.
Carmello Gainz: Sometimes it don't.
Empire VAs: So yeah.
Carmello Gainz: And then, yeah, you're gonna need the exact SMS for.
Carmello Gainz: It.
Carmello Gainz: So in, in terms of getting, getting numbers from Daisy, make sure to always add the area codes of Washington.
Carmello Gainz: So it doesn't, you know, it's not.
Carmello Gainz: It'S not easily detected as like disposable number.
Carmello Gainz: And Then yeah, just sometimes you can, you can add carriers.
Carmello Gainz: You can add carriers sometimes, but I suggest that you don't.
Carmello Gainz: But it depends on the day.
Carmello Gainz: Because it depends on Tinder as well.
Carmello Gainz: Because on Tinder, the way we do Tinder, sometimes it needs carrier, sometimes it needs.
Carmello Gainz: So basically what's working for Tinder is going to work for ig.
Carmello Gainz: So for, for today.
Carmello Gainz: No, Carrie.
Carmello Gainz: Okay, so if it comes to this, then it's probably dead.
Carmello Gainz: So you need to move on to the next profile.
Carmello Gainz: That's why I asked you like in.
Carmello Gainz: The beginning, like create three profiles at a time.
Carmello Gainz: So let's start another one.
Carmello Gainz: Hold on, I'll have my crater do it instead.
Empire VAs: This much.
Carmello Gainz: Hold on.
Carmello Gainz: It's just repairing everything.
Carmello Gainz: Okay, so he's gonna.
Carmello Gainz: Yeah, it's gonna start again.
Carmello Gainz: It's pretty much the same thing.
Carmello Gainz: It's just his process.
Carmello Gainz: Let's take.
Carmello Gainz: Speak up if you have any questions.
Ariel Erhaze: Alright, bro.
Ariel Erhaze: So what are you going to change for this attempt?
Carmello Gainz: No, nothing's going to change.
Carmello Gainz: It's just.
Carmello Gainz: The VA is much more accustomed to creating.
Carmello Gainz: Creating IGs.
Ariel Erhaze: Okay.
Ariel Erhaze: Okay, so we're going to use.
Ariel Erhaze: Okay.
Ariel Erhaze: Verizon.
Ariel Erhaze: Okay.
Ariel Erhaze: Carmelo, I think what if I buy mobile proxies and then we match the mobile proxy to the same one that is on gmark for Daisy.
Carmello Gainz: Yeah, but if you do that, you're.
Carmello Gainz: Gonna, you're gonna need to buy each.
Carmello Gainz: You're gonna need to buy HBA their own because you can't create with.
Carmello Gainz: You can't really.
Ariel Erhaze: I mean if like for all the future proxies that I buy for the like when we put them onto the phones.
Carmello Gainz: Sorry, what?
Ariel Erhaze: Like we're using Verizon.
Ariel Erhaze: Right.
Ariel Erhaze: So I'll just buy all Verizon 5G proxies.
Carmello Gainz: No, no, it's not.
Carmello Gainz: Verizon doesn't work all the time.
Ariel Erhaze: Okay, so then I'll just.
Carmello Gainz: Like I said.
Ariel Erhaze: Okay, so we'll just match them then.
Ariel Erhaze: So I'll buy Verizon.
Ariel Erhaze: Verizon at and T. And what?
Ariel Erhaze: Yes, I'll just buy them all and then whatever's.
Ariel Erhaze: Whatever SOP we're using, we'll match them.
Carmello Gainz: Yeah.

Nikita Tyukalo: It's like you run fanfic.
Dan: My co founder was the founder of Fanfics.
Dan: Yeah, he's the.
Dan: Yeah, Tanner.
Nikita Tyukalo: Go ahead.
Dan: Anyway, a year ago we went full time on this, which is Aroma.
Dan: And it's Basically the only US functional iPhone.
Dan: Phone farm.
Nikita Tyukalo: Hey, we.
Nikita Tyukalo: We don't want a phone farm.
Nikita Tyukalo: He did here explain to you exactly what we need.
Dan: You can.
Dan: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: I just want.
Nikita Tyukalo: I just want it to be set up for me, but I want it to be fully functional from my location.
Dan: Yeah.
Dan: So we can open you a location or we can host one for you.
Dan: It's really up to however you guys want it.
Nikita Tyukalo: I just.
Nikita Tyukalo: So I run pretty sensitive data that I sell.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So I just want to have full control of that.
Nikita Tyukalo: You guys want to set up the location, that's fine as well.
Nikita Tyukalo: But yeah.
Dan: So it's ultimately up to you how you want to do it.
Dan: For some of our larger partnerships, we'll.
Dan: We'll open a warehouse for the client and help them set it all up.
Dan: Or we can.
Nikita Tyukalo: How many phones can I handle?
Dan: We can.
Dan: We can do unlimited scale.
Dan: It just depends what you guys want to do.
Dan: Obviously there's like hardware costs, so that's going to be like the phone and then some other tech that like, we have and then obviously like electrical.
Nikita Tyukalo: What do you guys start at?
Nikita Tyukalo: What skill do you guys start at?
Dan: It really depends.
Dan: So we can run stuff for you and that starts around like 40 to 50k a month or, you know, for larger partnerships.
Dan: They'll it.
Dan: You know, we're pretty flexible, but it could look something like, hey, here's 250K.
Dan: Can you open us our own set the way that we've done?
Dan: Va remote control and you guys.
Nikita Tyukalo: So you guys.
Nikita Tyukalo: You guys, basically, you guys do remote control iPhones.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: But Ariel, did you explain them the way we need it?
Nikita Tyukalo: Huh?
Dan: Yeah, no, he can do it.
Dan: And as well just an aside but he also runs.
Nikita Tyukalo: So I run Snapchat.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So Snapchat has super sensitive restrictions.
Nikita Tyukalo: We can't imac plug.
Nikita Tyukalo: We can't do any of that extra.
Dan: Yeah, don't worry, we.
Dan: We run automations on all the platforms so we're like va.
Nikita Tyukalo: So you guys are good with all the sensitive platforms, all the restrictions, all that?
Dan: Yeah, you couldn't even tell that.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just let me know the details.
Nikita Tyukalo: There's not really much to talk about.
Nikita Tyukalo: If you guys can guarantee that you guys can bypass bands on snaps.
Nikita Tyukalo: Not bypass but like just not.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: Not get detected.
Nikita Tyukalo: Then it's all good.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just let me know the price.
Dan: Yeah.
Dan: So in that case I would personally recommend that we just set up a location for you.
Dan: And then the way that our system works is that there'll be like a website login for the VAs.
Dan: They can log on and then control the phones.
Dan: Yeah, I think that's like easiest.
Dan: That's what we do for a lot of people.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, that's easy.
Nikita Tyukalo: So that's all 250.
Dan: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: I send me over all the info.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's pretty easy.
Nikita Tyukalo: We can set that up and just.
Dan: Just tell me real quick while I have you on the phone, two things.
Dan: One, how many phones slash like Snapchat accounts.
Nikita Tyukalo: If this works then unlimited.
Dan: Okay.
Dan: But like to start can you, can.
Nikita Tyukalo: You guys help with location changing all that other.
Nikita Tyukalo: Even if it's and all in the same warehouse.
Dan: We should be able to figure that out.
Dan: Yeah but what we actually if you guys.
Nikita Tyukalo: If you guys.
Nikita Tyukalo: What would be best is if you guys could do some.
Nikita Tyukalo: I can give you guys some info of what we need but if you guys can do some research on Snap and basically help me kind of guarantee that you guys know exactly what we need because I've been on a bunch of these calls right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So all these people can guarantee, you know, that you know, this won't get restricted.
Nikita Tyukalo: This won't get restricted.
Nikita Tyukalo: But Snapchat, the way we use it, it's so specific.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: Relocation change.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like go ahead.
Dan: Yeah, the, the what we've like really been working on designing is like our tech layers are like basically undetectable.
Dan: So for all intensive purposes like under Snapchat's like lens, this is just going to look like the phone is located at our warehouse.
Dan: So that's why we don't with like locations spoofing too much and then.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, so I'm setting these phone farms up in each state, right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So because each state has a different algorithm But I'm fine with doing that over time.
Nikita Tyukalo: This first one works, but it's all legalized.
Nikita Tyukalo: All that other.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like, no problems with phone farms?
Dan: No, no, not at all.
Nikita Tyukalo: Are we gonna have to work around anything or.
Dan: No, no, we're undetectable.
Dan: So we.
Dan: We've yet to have, like, a single issue.
Nikita Tyukalo: No, I'm talking about the phone form itself.
Dan: Yeah, yeah, everything's good.
Dan: But the nice.
Nikita Tyukalo: The nice thing is what are the laws with some specific states on that?
Nikita Tyukalo: Because a lot of people talking about that.
Dan: There's.
Dan: There's no.
Dan: We're not even remotely close to breaking any laws because we're not impersonating anyone's identities for these.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's basically what we're doing.
Nikita Tyukalo: We're running a bunch of.
Nikita Tyukalo: Well, not.
Nikita Tyukalo: It could be on the line, right?
Nikita Tyukalo: So.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, so we're basically running the modeling.
Nikita Tyukalo: The modeling pages for the models, right?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Dan: As long as you have.
Dan: As long as you have their consent, it should be fine.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
Dan: And I. I don't think you would get, like, detected or investigated through any of this.
Dan: Regardless.
Dan: I will say, like, since if you want to be in every state, we can do something cool, which we have done, and I can send a video of it later.
Dan: It's just not at this house right now.
Dan: But we can build basically little boxes which can hold, you know, however many phones, and then we could deploy them, basically just like, throw them in people's basement in every.
Dan: Every state that you want.
Dan: And then we'll have the remote hookups to all those.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, that's fun.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, send me all the info.
Nikita Tyukalo: I'll send you over a couple things just to make sure you guys can guarantee it, and then we'll do it.
Dan: Okay, sweet.
Dan: All right.
Dan: Wait, one more thing.
Dan: He also wants to run affiliate further.
Nikita Tyukalo: He has.
Nikita Tyukalo: How many accounts do you have on.
Dan: IG and Tick Tock again, right now we have about a couple thousand running that we can do whatever with accounts on IG and TikTok to do.
Nikita Tyukalo: I can't even hear you.
Dan: All right.
Nikita Tyukalo: Hey, what are you saying?
Dan: To run affiliate of for the girls.
Dan: 2000 accounts so we can start.
Dan: I'm running affiliate on for the girls or forever, which I guess, however you want to split it up.
Nikita Tyukalo: What are you saying?
Dan: We basically, we.
Dan: With our phone farm, we have automated accounts.
Dan: Right.
Dan: That's like, really what we do.
Dan: So he's saying we can, you know, work something out.
Dan: We have, like, thousands of accounts running on every platform or I guess right now on Tech Talk and Instagram mainly.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, you guys just want to help span the models?
Dan: Yeah, we.
Dan: You know, if it makes sense for us.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, I mean, that.
Nikita Tyukalo: That we're doing that as well right now.
Nikita Tyukalo: So if you guys.
Nikita Tyukalo: If you guys want to help with that, that's easy.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, we can just give you affiliate money.
Nikita Tyukalo: I mean, it's easy money.
Nikita Tyukalo: You know, your marketing business.
Dan: So sweet.
Dan: Yeah, we.
Dan: We can talk about that.
Dan: And then as.
Dan: As well, I heard that you guys may need help acquiring pages.
Dan: If you want.
Dan: I can get that.
Dan: I just bought like 40 pages myself.
Dan: I can get that done.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, send me the info on the pages.
Nikita Tyukalo: Send me all the engagement stats, all the other stuff.
Dan: Well, I'm.
Dan: I can just go in the market and get them for you guys since I'm, like, the owner of most of these social media markets.
Nikita Tyukalo: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: We don't buy from markets.
Nikita Tyukalo: I only buy direct just because our market's working.
Nikita Tyukalo: A lot of times, you know, you can.
Nikita Tyukalo: The accounts are from, you know, previous bands or whatever.
Nikita Tyukalo: Whatever.
Dan: Okay, sweet.
Nikita Tyukalo: If you guys have anything, you can ensure account quality.
Dan: Yeah, well, I've.
Dan: That I can vet any account beforehand.
Dan: Check.
Dan: It's like strikes, copyright, ban, history, all that.
Dan: I have a pretty.
Dan: Pretty large name in the space, so people, you can't really just, like, be me.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, that makes sense.

Nikita Tyukalo: No, both.
Nikita Tyukalo: I mean, we already have editors, but for the girls, too.
Dan: All right.
Dan: Okay.
Dan: Yeah.
Dan: So basically we just need a small team, people that can just make scripts, content, do editing for them.

avraham adler: Well, I appreciate you coming on.
avraham adler: I mean, they just showed me a demo, I showed you my portfolio.
avraham adler: And then this was like, like literally a half hour before I got on the call with them and they just blew my mind.
avraham adler: And I know I wanted you to allocate funds on our portfolio to launch those fintechs.
avraham adler: If you take it back to him.
avraham adler: And once they show you the demo here, I think, of course we're going to do the models for you and I'll get Veronica to do it right away so that we can take him back to this call.
avraham adler: But I wanted you to see what they have under the belt.
avraham adler: Again, I all transparency.
avraham adler: I just met these guys, you know, half, 45 minutes ago.
avraham adler: But once they just showed me the demo, I was like.
avraham adler: And I've been in the space, you know, many businesses, like I told you earlier in the call, so I, I, I usually have a sense of something that's good.

avraham adler: No.
avraham adler: Is there?
C MDS Consulting: I don't know.
avraham adler: Just for the AI, right?
C MDS Consulting: Yeah, yeah, we could definitely implement into the.

Enoc Silva: Let's confirm all the details.
Enoc Silva: Yeah, I'd like to confirm.
Enoc Silva: Your property viewing is confirmed for Friday, January 16th.
Enoc Silva: So this one was for real estate.
Enoc Silva: And we also have a platform where you can just upload any files, connect your crna, your erp and it's going to visualize the data.
Enoc Silva: So the difference is you talk and the UI reacts in real time and the AI is talking constantly to you and it does that in less than 200 milliseconds.
Enoc Silva: So in the platform you can log in, you can log out, you can see your memories, you can for example, save all the graphs you generated before.
Enoc Silva: So here are some of the memories.
Enoc Silva: You can also log out and upload any kind of documents you want.
Enoc Silva: So I'm going to talk to this AI and in contact going to ask a couple of questions about the documents that I have on file.
Enoc Silva: Hello.
Enoc Silva: Let's get started with the visuals.
Enoc Silva: What data do you want to see on the screen?
Enoc Silva: Right now I wanted to focus on.
Enoc Silva: The current pricing plans, but only the ones for the real estate.
Enoc Silva: Setup fees.
Enoc Silva: Basic.
Enoc Silva: It will be better if I actually see just the current value proposition of the real estate version.
Enoc Silva: Real estate version set up 3500 monthly.
Enoc Silva: 330 Tour is pulling the data from the files or you can connect the crn, the ERP and it's just generating the graphs based on what is best on the information that it has available.
Nikita Tyukalo: Perfect.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then I guess you can just speak to it and then I'll, you know, develop, even change the UI based on how you.
Enoc Silva: Exactly.
Enoc Silva: Have you seen the movie Iron Man?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, yeah, sure.
Enoc Silva: Collision is building just Jarbase, the operating system that does everything from generating documents, PowerPoint and just manage your entire life.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
C MDS Consulting: And so from the AVI was mentioning like the model space and agencies.
C MDS Consulting: So imagine, you know, obviously you can go to a dashboard, you can see your earnings and everything else, but you could integrate it into this and you could say, you know, which, which, which of my models is making the most money?
C MDS Consulting: And then it's going to say this, okay, who's my top spender?
C MDS Consulting: Okay, what's, what's the best selling picture?
C MDS Consulting: Okay, why is it the best selling picture?
C MDS Consulting: I'm sorry, go ahead.
Sebastian Gonzalez Osorio: It will also give you advice like marketing strategies where you could implement more the money in the, in your business.
C MDS Consulting: Marketing.
C MDS Consulting: Marketing analytics.
C MDS Consulting: Which social media platform is, you know, doing the best?
C MDS Consulting: Which video is doing the best?
C MDS Consulting: Why is it doing the best?
C MDS Consulting: There's so many different applications into this obviously in that particular industry.
C MDS Consulting: To give you an example, in other industries, obviously you saw the real estate perspective for real estate agents.
C MDS Consulting: You know, ordering food shopping on Amazon, you know, shopping even on TikTok shop.
C MDS Consulting: There's multiple different use cases.
C MDS Consulting: Whether it's from a consumer retail sales perspective on that front facing or back end analytics and how you can, how your company's doing or how you can increase revenue on Your operations for the models.
Enoc Silva: We can also create a 3D model of the OnlyFans models and just clone their voice so people can talk 2, 10 at the same time.
Enoc Silva: Like a thousand, A million people can talk with the same model at the same time.
Sebastian Gonzalez Osorio: And also with the chat as well responding.
Sebastian Gonzalez Osorio: I'm sure that's already there, but it can also be implemented with the chat.
Sebastian Gonzalez Osorio: A lot of people like to chat and then send photos and videos, all that, and then pay for packages and whatnot.
C MDS Consulting: Yeah, there's a lot of, obviously there's already a lot of, you know, onlyfend agencies and models and automatic responses, but a lot of those are, you know, prompt based and could potentially respond, you know, with the wrong thing if you don't have the correct parameters.
C MDS Consulting: So the cool thing about this is it's, you know, it's going to show, it's going to be sensitive to emotion.
C MDS Consulting: It's also going to show emotion and sensitivity, which is important obviously in, you know, the adult industry.
C MDS Consulting: And not just you don't want it to sound like AI, obviously, you know, with voice labs and you know, getting the, the model's voice eloquent enough or sexy enough, you know, would be important, but it's actually going to listen and have a conversation with the person paying money which is going to in turn boost revenue and how they're interacting with that model.
C MDS Consulting: Aside from just texting or sexting.
Nikita Tyukalo: No, guys, I definitely, by the way, before I interject, like, were there any other demos that you have for me?
Nikita Tyukalo: I'm sorry, before I kind of interject and kind of start speaking a bit, were there any other demos that you wanted to show first at the moment?
Nikita Tyukalo: No.
C MDS Consulting: Yeah, those, those are the main three.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, perfect.
C MDS Consulting: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: So I just want to tell you guys, like, I really do have a, like a strong software background.
Nikita Tyukalo: So a lot of the stuff that you've built I definitely could build.
Nikita Tyukalo: But like the main thing for me at this point is like scaling a team of high, high leverage operators that basically have the same skills as I do.
Nikita Tyukalo: So I'll be definitely interested in kind of talking more about kind of that.
Nikita Tyukalo: Especially since at the moment what we want to do is launch an info product based around how much we're one of the top 10 OFM agencies on the planet.
Nikita Tyukalo: So realistically, like there's a lot of software that we could build and launch and really take over like the info space as related to ofm.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then you guys would definitely be quite the asset as far as building out this task that we're thinking of just an all encompassing SaaS to really compete with what's on the market right now.
C MDS Consulting: Yeah, we're patent pending on a lot of you.
C MDS Consulting: That's a conversation that we were having.
Nikita Tyukalo: Amazing.
C MDS Consulting: It's a great, it's a great point that you're bringing up though because the other person was asking her like well why don't I just go build it?
C MDS Consulting: And we're like, well for one nobody's doing it right.
C MDS Consulting: So like AI meta glasses and there's a very, very few amount of companies that are pursuing visual AI.
C MDS Consulting: But everybody such as we were just having a conversation with avi like Deep Seek in China and then Elon Musk and Sam Altman.
C MDS Consulting: Everybody's having a competition on tech space right now.
C MDS Consulting: Obviously you can get on ChatGPT, you can have, you know a conversation, you can actually show your camera as well.
C MDS Consulting: But the actual integration of, of you know, the milliseconds and tying into multiple different cases of your own business and or from a retailer consumer perspective, nobody attacking that market.
C MDS Consulting: So in some ways yes, somebody could spend a lot of money and a lot of time.
C MDS Consulting: But kind of the cool thing is Enoch has a 6 year plus background in AI and software development.
C MDS Consulting: So that's why we kind of have a little bit of the upper hand.
C MDS Consulting: This is also has the ability to be compliant with data as well as tie into existing private servers if a company has that or we can consult on how they can keep that data private.
C MDS Consulting: Also there's going to be a lot of data collection.
C MDS Consulting: So for your company there's a lot of demographics.
C MDS Consulting: Not sharing the personal information but those demographics.
C MDS Consulting: You could then collect all that data through this visual AI agent.
C MDS Consulting: It can categorize it, it can send notifications to your team as well as to WhatsApp Expand across all social media platforms as well.
C MDS Consulting: And then that demographic of the age and what people's interests are as well, you can turn around and you can collect that data as a company and that's going to be an additional revenue source base because then you could go sell that demographic data to a Mondelez or multiple data agencies that are wanting to know what type of interest people have, you know, for whatever category it is.
C MDS Consulting: So and just to let you know which kind of shows the testament of our development team as well as you know, Enoch and Sebastian's background.
C MDS Consulting: This was all built in six months but the technology and experience goes six years plus.
C MDS Consulting: And so we're, we're quick to market in a lot of different areas conversations that we're having right now though is like credit repair.
C MDS Consulting: I think that would be a good one to give an example because it's, you know, it's very popular right now from see, you know, in an entrepreneurship vibe such as only fan agencies and it sounds like you've done very, very well for yourself.
C MDS Consulting: But you know, I have a credit repair company and have.
C MDS Consulting: Have scaled a good amount of that.
C MDS Consulting: Imagine somebody just getting on and having a conversation about the credit and they're not having to book a call, then they're not missing that call.
C MDS Consulting: Your retention rate is going to be higher.
C MDS Consulting: You're not going to have a high sales pressure.
C MDS Consulting: They're going to feel a lot more comfortable signing up for whatever that is.
C MDS Consulting: So those use cases that we're thinking on, how it could apply to the adult industry as well.
C MDS Consulting: But yeah, we're all about building together if we could save you time and money and implement another source.
avraham adler: But again, he comes from a development program.
avraham adler: That's why I reached out to him.
avraham adler: Also in the fact that we unite today and we could do the marketing together.
avraham adler: And this is a better implication.
avraham adler: Plus they're liquid heavy like he sold me, so I figured he can just come in.
avraham adler: So, yeah, I mean, like you said, he wants us to engage with the models.
avraham adler: We'll onboard them.
avraham adler: I'll have Veronica do the deck tomorrow.
avraham adler: I mean, do you have Ariel?
avraham adler: Do you have anything to add?
avraham adler: Your synergy?
avraham adler: What do you think, Ariel?
Nikita Tyukalo: Like, if we can make like a group chat.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's just pretty late.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's about 3am that's totally fine actually, but.
Nikita Tyukalo: And then I'll send a bunch of info as far as like the software suites that I've kind of built so far and then how we can integrate and kind of hit the ground running.
Nikita Tyukalo: But yeah, because we really want to launch this info product pretty soon.
Nikita Tyukalo: The kid is quite liquid.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like he's the owner.
Nikita Tyukalo: I'm, I just kind of.
Nikita Tyukalo: We networked a little bit.
Nikita Tyukalo: I came out to kind of visit and then he saw that, okay, wow, this kid actually has like iq.
Nikita Tyukalo: Then I ended up dropping out of med school and he kind of made me director.
Nikita Tyukalo: And this was all just a couple.
C MDS Consulting: Months ago, so very nice.
C MDS Consulting: Congrats.
Nikita Tyukalo: Thank you, brother.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like, he's, he's in quite a few different agencies.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's not just, it's not just the adult industry.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's in, he's serial entrepreneur.
Nikita Tyukalo: So like every industry you can think of, he's touched.
Nikita Tyukalo: He's really playing the game at quite the high level.
Nikita Tyukalo: So if we can really prep something together where the pitch deck is solid.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: I have no doubt that they were.
avraham adler: Saying a $10 million buy in at a 55 million evaluation.
avraham adler: There's many implications with our networking and you know, our alliances now that we just engaged.
avraham adler: I'm sure we'll, we'll, we'll make it work.
avraham adler: Yeah.
avraham adler: So, yeah, that's what I want.
C MDS Consulting: And, and Ariel, if you can, like you said, we'll get in the group, group chat, share as much info as possible and kind of, you know, you have a software background.
C MDS Consulting: So how, how would you, how would you see this applying to your existing model?
C MDS Consulting: Maybe some goals and then we can, you know, do the diverse engineering from that and build a pilot based on it.
C MDS Consulting: But we are the, the two, the two structures right now is either a exclusivity offer specifically for entry because like for example, your industry, nobody to my knowledge, and we've done extensive research, nobody's really pursuing this.
C MDS Consulting: So if you wanted something exclusive, we could structure a deal based on that or we could structure a pilot program based off of a subscription model and then a cost per minute.
C MDS Consulting: We'll customize the deal.
C MDS Consulting: We're all about making it mutually beneficial so that our revenue is going to grow together.
C MDS Consulting: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay, awesome.
Nikita Tyukalo: I think like something like that would probably go, that would be instantly agreed upon by Nikita would be something like if we build out the software suite for, for the info product and then we give out, we're promoting and marketing on the SaaS, then that way we could partner on that and it would be probably pretty easy.
Nikita Tyukalo: We just haven't.
Nikita Tyukalo: We just need more content from him and for him to record the course and that, that's going to be done over the next couple weeks.
Nikita Tyukalo: But then at that point like marketing the SaaS for.
Nikita Tyukalo: I was specifically talking about the people who buy the Orime course.
Nikita Tyukalo: We could, you know, partner on, on the, whatever the credits cost or whatever and then partner on that side of like a.
C MDS Consulting: Do like a rev share or something, you know?
C MDS Consulting: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
C MDS Consulting: We'll, we'll put, we'll, we'll wait to get the information from you and then we'll kind of put a presentation together and then you can give us like a red line kind of feedback and then we'll put something together and look forward to, to the relationship.
C MDS Consulting: Appreciate your time.

avraham adler: While he was.
avraham adler: And Jonathan said, I didn't realize because I didn't really watch a demo because I'm more involved, like I said, on the brokering side of things.

avraham adler: He said.

Speakers: Nikita Tyukalo, avraham adler, Veronica Welch
Sentences: Nikita Tyukalo: I own a couple agencies and this is Ariel, that connected us, but he structures deals for me.
Nikita Tyukalo: So Ariel, walk me through real quick.
Nikita Tyukalo: Which.
Nikita Tyukalo: This is the info packet you sent.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
avraham adler: Hey, Veronica.
Nikita Tyukalo: I'll just have them explain it.
avraham adler: Ariel, we're here to discuss the models that were given to us to onboard.
avraham adler: To start with one of them and then potentially you said you have like 13 and then more behind it, right?
Nikita Tyukalo: We, we have a lot more than that, but yeah.
avraham adler: Okay, so we want to start, you know, onboarding them, showing you our capabilities.
avraham adler: Veronica here is 20 years plus in the social media, PR, marketing.
avraham adler: We have a lot of synergy.
avraham adler: We have, she, she and I are partners in this and we have events, we have influencers, we have, we run fashion shows, music festivals, political campaigns, things of that nature.
avraham adler: But in terms of, you know, how they're going to manage in the revenue streams and how we're going to go about it, I'll let Veronica because this is her specialty.
avraham adler: I just manage my businesses and this is one of them.
avraham adler: So, Veronica, if you could please.
avraham adler: This is Ariel with a bunch of models that I sent you with the one file to start on.
Veronica Welch: Awesome.
Veronica Welch: Hi, nice to meet you.
Nikita Tyukalo: Hey, nice to meet you.
Veronica Welch: And where are you based?
Nikita Tyukalo: In Seattle.
Veronica Welch: Okay.
Veronica Welch: Okay, great.
avraham adler: He's in Tulum right now, enjoying his best time of his life.
Veronica Welch: Nice, nice.
Veronica Welch: Enjoy.
Veronica Welch: So where are, I mean, are your models pretty much like all over the US or are they.
Nikita Tyukalo: They're all around.
Nikita Tyukalo: So basically I have over a thousand models.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's counting, salary split, whatever.
Nikita Tyukalo: Whatever.
avraham adler: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: I run like black hat mostly.
Nikita Tyukalo: So I run a bunch of texting, a bunch of telegram stuff and we make, you know, a good amount like that.
Nikita Tyukalo: But we're looking to get into more like big scale creators.
Nikita Tyukalo: I work with a few right now, but we're trying to run up a bunch of girls from zero.
Nikita Tyukalo: And we have a lot of girls that go from like 0 to 200 or 0, 300 off, you know, just mass accounting and stuff like that their first months.
Nikita Tyukalo: And that's very easy for us to do, but a lot of these girls have a lot more potential than that.
Nikita Tyukalo: And we're trying to get into, you know, 2, 3, 4 million a month with certain girls because, you know, they, they fit the look and they're really, really good.
Nikita Tyukalo: But we need a sustainable system that, you know, is fast and quick with people that, you know, are capable enough of doing it.
Nikita Tyukalo: And we don't want to take away from the time that we're using, you know, for other things.
Nikita Tyukalo: So that's basically just what we're looking for.
avraham adler: And just to interject before Veronica speaks to that we also have our and I'm an entrepreneur.
avraham adler: I've owned and operated over 30 companies.
avraham adler: I'm actually spearheading a trump organization to onboard Kazakhstan to bring in all American products there.
avraham adler: So like I'm very knowledgeable in the space.
avraham adler: My connections run deep.
avraham adler: We could definitely help onboard the brands as you grow the influencers and like let's say you want to do a jewelry store, you want to do whatever the flip dirt there passion is and Veronica and her team will onboard and get their vision and of course with your guidance and how you want to allocate essentially.
avraham adler: And I also have infrastructure for distribution and partnerships with people like Ulta and whatever, you know.
avraham adler: And Veronica on the flip side also with her events that she runs with, you know, all the majors.
avraham adler: So once we get to a certain sustainable, you know, revenue stream, we could enter those retails again.
avraham adler: We're very flexible.
avraham adler: Why not?
avraham adler: We try to accommodate the client.
avraham adler: You being the client, you give us the vision, you give us the trajectory.
avraham adler: We'll build you a deck and we'll present it to you.
avraham adler: We'll give you like obviously you know, nobody could guarantee anything.
avraham adler: We could show you case studies and Veronica could speak now more to the back end of our data and what we have.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, we, we just need a you know, a system that we can apply and you know, something that you know, we can see good results with and some that works for everybody.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just because we have so many models, we don't want to decrease the amount that we have.
Nikita Tyukalo: But we also want to add in you know these higher leverage systems for the girls that we need them for.
Nikita Tyukalo: And we basically have salary models for most girls.
Nikita Tyukalo: Even if girls are running on 50, 50 splits, as soon as they reach a certain amount they, their percentage goes down.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So if they get not goes down but they get capped.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So if we're paying girl 30, 40k for her accounts at 400k we're still keeping that money on top because we're agency dependent system.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So if we're basically trying to take those girls as high as possible and a lot of them perform really, really well because they fit the perfect look and we just want to expand on that.
avraham adler: And also we have the background in the fashion modeling industry.
avraham adler: We're aligned with a lot of brands and the clothing again there's a lot of synergy.
avraham adler: And then once we have the models in our internal system we could use them to influence and you Know, go get the revenue higher.
avraham adler: So.
avraham adler: Veronica, please.
Veronica Welch: Sure.
Veronica Welch: Yeah, I just wanted to ask, so is there a particular platform or platforms that you want to focus on?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, I mean, just.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just domains.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: Like TikTok and Instagram, and we just want to build real brands for a lot of these girls and.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Veronica Welch: Okay.
Veronica Welch: And then the brands also, too.
Veronica Welch: I mean, then you're also open to kind of like sponsorship deals or endorsement deals or partnerships.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, a lot of our girls already do get them, but we haven't had somebody that's taking that over for us.
Nikita Tyukalo: So, yeah, we want to get into that and also expand on top of it.
Nikita Tyukalo: But we get, like, a bunch of casino deals and, you know, all that other stuff that we have now.
avraham adler: Yeah, so we have alignments with clubs.
avraham adler: Go ahead, Veronica.
Veronica Welch: Yeah, I was just gonna ask you, and are any of the girls doing, like, only fans or brand army?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, a lot of them are doing only fans.
Veronica Welch: Okay.
Veronica Welch: Okay, awesome.
Veronica Welch: So do you have a current website or anything, too, that I could also take?
Nikita Tyukalo: So we're setting that up right now because of this.
Nikita Tyukalo: Because this is what we're trying to get into.
Nikita Tyukalo: But like I said, we run a bunch of, like.
Nikita Tyukalo: So we'll be.
Nikita Tyukalo: We basically have a bunch of, you know, developers, coders, whatever.
Nikita Tyukalo: Whatever.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: We'll set up girls from Zero.
Nikita Tyukalo: We'll set them up on Snapchat.
Nikita Tyukalo: We'll get a girl to, like, 30K, 40K, 100K on Snap.
Nikita Tyukalo: And we do that in a bunch of different states.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: Because the algorithm's all different.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So that's how these girls get so high in numbers without having brand presence.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: And that's.
Nikita Tyukalo: Instead of doing that, we're trying to basically expand on actual main accounts and having, you know, a real brand for each one of the models that we're trying to apply to, and then still keeping their accounts that we run in each state.
Veronica Welch: Great.
Veronica Welch: Okay.
Veronica Welch: Okay.
Veronica Welch: Not a problem.
Veronica Welch: I think, you know, what we can do is obviously we can share with you a few examples of other people that we've worked with in the past, you know, people that we're working currently.
Veronica Welch: But I think if you maybe could also send us over maybe two or three girls as examples that you've built that you would like us to kind of, like, develop a strategy around.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Veronica Welch: And that way we can easily explain to you.
Nikita Tyukalo: We have, since a lot of girls do of, we'll get a girl to, you know, 100, 200k pretty easily within two or three weeks, and a lot of them end up getting banned and you know, even when we cover the accounts, it's not the same.
Nikita Tyukalo: So we really want to focus on that.
Nikita Tyukalo: You know, have long term account health and et cetera, et cetera.
avraham adler: You should know I was actually presented to purchase only fans 4 billions.
avraham adler: Not so long ago, somebody bid me on the bid.
avraham adler: But we internal or some of our team members are actually people.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, I heard about that.
avraham adler: What about the purchase?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, when.
Nikita Tyukalo: When it was getting offered up?
avraham adler: Yeah.
avraham adler: So I was one of the bids.
avraham adler: But do you know.
Nikita Tyukalo: Do you know Sam Batesh by chance?
avraham adler: No.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
avraham adler: But one of eternal members and several of them, I think, Veronica, Am I correct or only a couple?
Veronica Welch: Yeah.
Veronica Welch: No, several of them are also like internal.
Veronica Welch: So if you ever have someone that's banned, we can easily help to unban them.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, I mean, we don't have problems with the unbanned.
Nikita Tyukalo: It's just the way we.
Nikita Tyukalo: We run it.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So we'll get girls posting 10, 14 times a day, and then we'll just recreate all the images.
Nikita Tyukalo: And since they.
Nikita Tyukalo: So they'll basically go from like 10 to 20 to 30k, and then in one day we'll get 100k.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just because they have so many posts that are going viral.
Nikita Tyukalo: And when it consistently gets banned off one post and we have a hundred posts that are working towards good engagement on our models.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: All that goes down.
Nikita Tyukalo: So we basically have to restart every single time.
Nikita Tyukalo: Even if they have pages from 200 at 200 or 300 or 400.
Nikita Tyukalo: You get what I'm saying?
Veronica Welch: Okay.
Veronica Welch: Yeah.
Veronica Welch: So I think if you wouldn't mind sending us over, just maybe like, just two girls is fine.
Veronica Welch: So we can take a look at it and then let's, you know, come back to you with what our suggestions would be and how we can basically streamline all of this.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
Nikita Tyukalo: All right, sounds good.
avraham adler: I mean, I don't know if you want to do the brands first.
avraham adler: You want.
avraham adler: You want to walk before you run.
avraham adler: You know, we're getting to know you, you're getting to know.
avraham adler: We want to make sure it's a good fit.
avraham adler: Veronica is, like I said, 20 years in the industry.
avraham adler: I've been 20 years serial entrepreneur.
avraham adler: We're all great relationships.
avraham adler: We could reach anybody.
avraham adler: We want alliances, E.T.
avraham adler: so let's.
avraham adler: Yeah, let's walk before we run.
avraham adler: Send that over.
avraham adler: We'll create a deck for you.
avraham adler: You know, I think they mentioned the budget of 5,000 to start a month.
avraham adler: You know, we could see what the.
avraham adler: Unless I'm correct me if I'm wrong, is there a Different video.
Nikita Tyukalo: No, yeah, no, we.
Nikita Tyukalo: We can do more than that.
Nikita Tyukalo: That's fine.
Nikita Tyukalo: We just want.
Nikita Tyukalo: I just want to see what you guys, you know, think and what you guys want to do.
avraham adler: Okay, so.
avraham adler: Okay, so tell me your vision.
avraham adler: You just want products, I said.
avraham adler: You said you have a thousand girls.
avraham adler: Obviously, we can't launch a thousand products.
avraham adler: You want to, like, start with top tier?
avraham adler: Like, send us tutu?
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, yeah, just girls and, you know, all these girls.
Nikita Tyukalo: So I have a bunch of content houses.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right?
Nikita Tyukalo: So I have.
Nikita Tyukalo: In Seattle, I have 12.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: And I have four.
Nikita Tyukalo: So three groups of four right next to each other.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right.
Nikita Tyukalo: So a lot of these girls eat off of each other's, you know, followings.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right?
Nikita Tyukalo: So if some of the girls perform good, they all will.
Nikita Tyukalo: Right?
Nikita Tyukalo: So it's pretty easy.
Nikita Tyukalo: Just as long as we have proof of concept and, you know, we kind of get a system going.
Nikita Tyukalo: We're fine with, you know, onboarding faster, but.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah, we can start slow at first.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
avraham adler: And I just want to make sure that you're happy and we're happy.
avraham adler: I mean.
Nikita Tyukalo: Yeah.
avraham adler: To become recommended.
avraham adler: We appreciate the relationship.
avraham adler: Let's get it started.

Nikita Tyukalo: Okay.
avraham adler: Thank you so much.
Nikita Tyukalo: I can answer any other questions that you have.
Veronica Welch: Awesome.
Veronica Welch: Yeah, no, I think we're good for now.
Veronica Welch: I think if you just send me over, like, an example or two of the girls that you're, you know, you're referring to, then we can take a look at it, and we'll come back to you guys with, like, a full proposal and outline of everything for us to discuss.
avraham adler: And then I dropped a couple weeks.
Nikita Tyukalo: In WhatsApp, if you click, like, Ava Owens and then go to her following those girls that she's following the larger accounts, just take some of the larger ones to follow here.
Nikita Tyukalo: Links in WhatsApp.
Veronica Welch: Did you see it?
Veronica Welch: Is it in a WhatsApp AVI that you're in?
avraham adler: I sent it to you, remember?
avraham adler: The girl that you said how old she is?
avraham adler: But I'll send it to you again.
Veronica Welch: Oh, yes.
Veronica Welch: I think she had, like, about 30,000 followers.
Veronica Welch: But send it to me again.
